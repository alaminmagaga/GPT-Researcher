Agriculture in Lagos, Nigeria, is largely rain-fed and climate change negatively impacts crop productivity by decreasing crop yield and soil fertility, limiting the availability of soil water, increasing soil erosion, and contributing to the spread of pests. A decline in crop production due to climate change may be further exasperated by a lack of access to farming technology that reduces over-reliance on the rain-fed farming system and subsistence agriculture. This study indicates that there is a need for initiatives to motivate young and older farmers through access to credits, irrigation facilities, and innovative climate change adaptive strategies.

This study examines the effects of, and farmer's perceptions of, climate change on farming practices for cassava and maize in Lagos, Nigeria. Analysis of weather data from 1998 to 2018 (the most recent available) reveals little impact on cassava yield but a significant impact on maize yield. Furthermore, survey results indicate that farmers in this area are currently implementing techniques to adapt to changes in climate based on the type of crop grown. Agriculture in Lagos, Nigeria, is largely rain-fed and climate change negatively impacts crop productivity by decreasing crop yield and soil fertility, limiting the availability of soil water, increasing soil erosion, and contributing to the spread of pests. A decline in crop production due to climate change may be further exasperated by a lack of access to farming technology that reduces over-reliance on the rain-fed farming system and subsistence\n",

Uncertainty about future climate is captured, using, as inputs, yield changes computed by a crop model under ten general circulation models runs. Climate change turns out to be negative for Nigeria in the medium term, with production losses and increase in crop prices, higher food dependency on foreign imports, and GDP losses in all the simulations after 2025.

            "Content: Climate change presents weighty challenges globally, with Nigeria particularly vulnerable to its multifaceted impacts. This review explores the effects of climate change-induced droughts and floods on food security in Nigeria, where agriculture is central to economic stability and livelihoods. The analysis integrates a comprehensive metadata evaluation, identifying trends, thematic gaps, and regional disparities in existing research. It examines how extreme weather events have intensified issues related to food supply, economic resilience, and well-being, underscoring the critical need for adaptive strategies. A systematic review of 2,500 publications, following PRISMA criteria, narrowed the focus to 450 studies, with 104 highquality studies undergoing in-depth analysis. Metadata analysis revealed an increase in research interest post-2010, a lack of longitudinal studies, and an underrepresentation of semiarid northern regions in the literature. Findings indicate a growing threat to\n",

The results further demonstrate that farmers have developed and tested various strategies to reduce the effects of climate change. This highlights their proactive approach to adopting measures to mitigate climate change and their ability to innovate and adapt to the changing environment. The results from the factor analysis categorized the strategies adopted by farmers into two categories namely agronomic methods and research methods for adaptation.

            "\n",
            "Climate change has emerged as one of the most pressing global challenges of the 21st century, with its impacts being felt across various sectors, including agriculture. In Nigeria, where agriculture plays a pivotal role in the economy and livelihoods, the effects of climate change are particularly pronounced. Agriculture contributes approximately 24% to Nigeria's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and employs about 70% of the population ([Frontiers, 2024](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/sustainable-food-systems/articles/10.3389/fsufs.2024.1490133/abstract)). However, rising temperatures, erratic rainfall patterns, and extreme weather events such as floods and droughts are significantly disrupting agricultural productivity. This report delves into the multifaceted impacts of climate change on Nigerian agriculture, drawing on detailed studies and expert analyses.\n",

            "## Key Impacts of Climate Change on Nigerian Agriculture\n",
            "\n",
            "### 1. **Rising Temperatures and Changing Precipitation Patterns**\n",
            "\n",
            "One of the most evident impacts of climate change in Nigeria is the increase in average temperatures and the alteration of rainfall patterns. These changes affect crop growth cycles, reduce yields, and alter the suitability of certain crops for specific regions. According to Prof. Sani Miko, a renowned agricultural expert, these climatic shifts have led to shortened growing seasons and reduced crop suitability in many parts of Nigeria ([Ahmadu Bello University, 2023](https://abu.edu.ng/expert-lists-climate-change-impacts-on-nigerian-agriculture/)).\n",
            "\n",
            "For instance, staple crops such as maize, rice, and cassava are highly sensitive to temperature fluctuations. A study by Osuji et al. (2023) revealed that crops like rice (yielding approximately 7,850.23 kg annually per farmer) and cassava (6,492.41 kg annually) dominate Nigerian agriculture, but their productivity is increasingly threatened by erratic weather ([SpringerLink, 2023](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-21007-5_3)).\n",
            "\n",
            "---\n",
            "\n",
            "### 2. **Increased Frequency and Severity of Droughts and Floods**\n",
            "\n",
            "Nigeria experiences extreme weather events, including prolonged droughts in the northern regions and devastating floods in the southern areas. These events are becoming more frequent and severe due to climate change. Droughts lead to water scarcity, reduce soil fertility, and hinder crop growth, while floods destroy farmlands and displace farming communities.\n",
            "\n",
            "A systematic review of 2,500 studies highlighted that extreme weather events have exacerbated food insecurity in Nigeria, with floods and droughts being the primary culprits ([Frontiers, 2024](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/sustainable-food-systems/articles/10.3389/fsufs.2024.1490133/abstract)). The review also noted that the semi-arid northern regions are particularly vulnerable, yet they remain underrepresented in climate research.\n",

            "---\n",
            "\n",
            "### 3. **Shifts in Pest and Disease Dynamics**\n",
            "\n",
            "Climate change has altered the dynamics of pests and diseases, further complicating agricultural activities in Nigeria. Warmer temperatures and increased humidity create favorable conditions for the proliferation of pests such as the fall armyworm and diseases like maize streak virus. These challenges reduce crop yields and increase the cost of pest control measures.\n",
            "\n",
            "Prof. Sani Miko emphasized that changes in pest and disease dynamics are among the most significant impacts of climate change on Nigerian agriculture ([Ahmadu Bello University, 2023](https://abu.edu.ng/expert-lists-climate-change-impacts-on-nigerian-agriculture/)). Farmers are often ill-equipped to deal with these emerging threats, leading to substantial economic losses.\n",

            "\n",
            "### 4. **Impacts on Livestock Productivity and Health**\n",
            "\n",
            "Livestock farming, a critical component of Nigeria's agricultural sector, is also adversely affected by climate change. Rising temperatures and water scarcity reduce the availability of pasture and water for livestock, leading to decreased productivity and higher mortality rates. Heat stress and the spread of vector-borne diseases further exacerbate the challenges faced by livestock farmers.\n",
            "\n",
            "A study by Bosello et al. (2017) projected that climate change would lead to significant GDP losses in Nigeria, partly due to reduced livestock productivity ([SpringerLink, 2017](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10640-016-0105-4)).\n",

            "### 5. **Economic Implications**\n",
            "\n",
            "The economic consequences of climate change on Nigerian agriculture are profound. Reduced crop yields and livestock productivity lead to higher food prices, increased dependency on food imports, and a decline in farmers' incomes. A computable general equilibrium model tailored to Nigeria's economy predicted that climate change would cause GDP losses and heightened food dependency after 2025 ([SpringerLink, 2017](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10640-016-0105-4)).\n",
            "\n",
            "In addition, a study by Osuji et al. (2023) estimated that Nigerian farmers generate an average income of ₦172,000 annually from crop sales. However, this income is at risk due to the adverse effects of climate change ([SpringerLink, 2023](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-21007-5_3)).\n",

            "\n",
            "Climate change-induced disruptions in agriculture have far-reaching implications for food security in Nigeria. The combination of reduced crop yields, increased food prices, and economic instability threatens the ability of households to access sufficient and nutritious food. A review of adaptation strategies underscored the critical need for measures to address food insecurity in the face of climate change ([Frontiers, 2024](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/sustainable-food-systems/articles/10.3389/fsufs.2024.1490133/abstract)).\n",

            "\n",
            "To mitigate the impacts of climate change on agriculture, Nigerian farmers and policymakers are adopting various adaptation strategies. These include:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Agro-Ecological Intensification (AEI):** This involves practices such as intercropping, crop rotation, and the use of organic fertilizers to improve soil health and resilience ([Frontiers, 2024](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/climate/articles/10.3389/fclim.2024.1272320/full)).\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Adoption of Improved Crop Varieties:** Farmers are increasingly cultivating drought-resistant and pest-resistant crop varieties to enhance productivity under adverse conditions ([Frontiers, 2024](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/climate/articles/10.3389/fclim.2024.1272320/full)).\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Water Management Practices:** Techniques such as rainwater harvesting, irrigation, and mulching help conserve water and improve crop yields during dry spells ([Frontiers, 2024](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/climate/articles/10.3389/fclim.2024.1272320/full)).\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Capacity Building and Extension Services:** Providing farmers with access to climate information, training, and extension services enables them to adopt effective adaptation practices ([Ahmadu Bello University, 2023](https://abu.edu.ng/expert-lists-climate-change-impacts-on-nigerian-agriculture/)).\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Afforestation and Agroforestry:** Planting trees and integrating them into farming systems helps mitigate climate change impacts by reducing soil erosion, enhancing biodiversity, and sequestering carbon ([Frontiers, 2024](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/climate/articles/10.3389/fclim.2024.1272320/full)).\n",

            "\n",
            "## Conclusion\n",
            "\n",
            "The impacts of climate change on Nigerian agriculture are multifaceted and far-reaching, affecting crop and livestock productivity, food security, and economic stability. Rising temperatures, erratic rainfall, and extreme weather events pose significant challenges to farmers, who are often ill-equipped to cope with these changes. However, adopting adaptation strategies such as agro-ecological intensification, improved crop varieties, and water management practices can help mitigate these impacts.\n",
            "\n",
            "Policymakers must prioritize investments in climate-resilient agriculture, research, and capacity building to safeguard Nigeria's agricultural sector and ensure food security for its growing population. Addressing the challenges posed by climate change requires a concerted effort from all stakeholders, including government agencies, research institutions, and farming communities.\n",

The evaluation is performed by shocking land productivity in a computable general equilibrium model tailored to replicate Nigerian economic development up to 2050. The detail of land uses in the model has been increased by differentiating land types per agro-ecological zones. Uncertainty about future climate is captured, using, as inputs, yield changes computed by a crop model under ten general circulation models runs. Climate change turns out to be negative for Nigeria in the medium term, with production losses and increase in crop prices, higher food dependency on foreign imports, and GDP losses in all the simulations after 2025. In a second part of the paper, a cost effectiveness analysis of adaptation in Nigerian agriculture is conducted. The adaptation practices considered are a mix of cheaper “soft measures” and more costly “hard” irrigation expansion. The main result is that the cost effectiveness of the whole package depends crucially on the possibility of implementing adaptation by exploiting low-cost opportunities which show a benefit-cost ratio larger than one in all the climate regimes.

The study therefore assumes its uniform development.The CMCC-MED global model is the reference GCM for the COSMO-CLM model (Scoccimarro et al. 2011).Regional Climate Models are defined as limited-area models which are used to dynamically ‘downscale’, global model simulations for some particular geographical region to provide more detailed information, Flato et al. (2013)”.The 10 GCMs considered are all reproducing the A1B scenario. This scenario is under A1 storyline, which describes a world characterised by high economic growth and regional convergence, but we assumed a balanced use of fossil and non-fossil energy sources proper of A1B scenario (Nakicenovic et al. 2000). We consider this storyline consistent economic scenario described in the “Nigeria Vision 20:2020” (FGN 2010): high GDP growth, decreasing VA share of agricultural sector, and increasing VA share of services.In our analysis, we account only for the uncertainty due to the choice of the climate model. We are not considering the uncertainty due to emission scenarios, which is limited in the medium term according to the literature (Lionello 2012). Furthermore, the uncertainty related to the choice of the crop and the economic model is also disregarded.Among the 10 GCM simulation considered, 9 comes from the Couple Models Intercomparison Project 3 (http://www-pcmdi.llnl.gov/ipcc/about_ipcc.php): CNRM_CM3, CSIRO_Mk3.5, GFDL_cm2.1, IAP_FGOALS, CCSR_MIROC3.2, MPI_ECHAM5, MRI_CGCM_2.3.2, NCAR_CCSM3, and UKMO_HadCM3. The last simulation is from the CMCC-MED global model (0.75 \\\\(^{\\\\circ }\\\\) resolution).Nonetheless, for completeness of information, production changes of these crops are also reported. But they depend upon changes in relative prices and are not directly imputable to climate-induced yield changes.Note that the drop in production also affects the other two crop aggregates, “vegetables and fruits” and “other crops” which are not directly concerned by the yield decline. This is due to a general contraction of the Nigerian economy in the climate change scenario. Bosello et al. (2007) noted that this procedure represents adaptation as a pure cost, neglecting the potential multiplicative effects of adaptation investment on the economy. They thus propose to trade off adaptation investment with consumption rather than with other investments.

Industries are “typically” modelled through a representative cost-minimizing firm, taking input prices as given. In turn, output prices are given by average production costs. The production functions are specified via a series of nested CES functions. Peculiar to ICES is the “isolation” in the production tree of energy factors which are taken out from the set of intermediate inputs and are inserted as primary production factors in a nested level of substitution with capital. The following figure shows the production structure of the model.Fig. 6ICES nested production functionFull size image At the top of Fig. 6, production stems from the combination of intermediate inputs (QF) and a value added composite including all primary factors and energy (QVAEN). Perfect complementarity is assumed between value added and intermediates. This implies the adoption a Leontief production function. For sector i in region r final supply (output) results from the following constrained production cost minimization problem for the producer:$$\\\\begin{aligned}&\\\\min PVAEN_{i,r} QVAEN_{i,r} +PF_{i,r} QF_{i,r} \\\\\\\\&s.t. \\\\,Y_{i,r} =\\\\min \\\\left[ QVAEN_{i,r} ,QF_{i,r} \\\\right] \\\\end{aligned}$$where PVAEN and PF are prices of the related production factors.The second nested-level in Fig. 6 represents, on the left hand side, the value added plus energy composite (QVAEN). This composite stems from a CES function that combines four primary factors: land (QLAND), natural resources (QFE), labour (QFE) and the capital-energy bundle (QKE) using \\\\(\\\\sigma \\\\)VAE as elasticity of substitution. Primary factor demand on its turn derives from the first order conditions of the following constrained cost minimization problem for the representative firm:$$\\\\begin{aligned}&\\\\min P_{i,r}^{Land} LAND_{i,r} +P_{i,r}^{NR} NR_{i,r} +P_{i,r}^L L_{i,r} +P_{i,r}^{KE} KE_{i,r} \\\\\\\\&s.t.\\\\, QVAEN_{i,r,t} =\\\\left. {\\\\left( {LAND_{i,r}^{\\\\frac{\\\\sigma _{VAE} -1}{\\\\sigma _{VAE} }} +NR_{i,r}^{\\\\frac{\\\\sigma _{VAE} -1}{\\\\sigma _{VAE} }} +L_{i,r}^{\\\\frac{\\\\sigma _{VAE} -1}{\\\\sigma _{VAE} }} +KE_{i,r}^{\\\\frac{\\\\sigma _{VAE} -1}{\\\\sigma _{VAE} }} } \\\\right. } \\\\right) ^{\\\\frac{\\\\sigma _{VAE} }{\\\\sigma _{VAE} -1}} \\\\end{aligned}$$In the third nested-level, the QLAND bundle combines the AEZ-specific land types and the KE bundle combines capital with a set of different energy inputs. This is a peculiarity of GTAP-E and ICES model. In fact, energy inputs are not part of the intermediates, but are combined to capital in a specific composite.Furthermore, Energy is produced using Electric and Non Electric commodities in the Fourth nested-level, while the Non Electric commodity is produced using Coal and Otherfuel commodities. At the basic level of the production tree, there are Gas, Oil, Petroleum Products and Biofuels.Notice that domestic and foreign inputs are not perfect substitutes, according to the so-called “Armington assumption”, which accounts for—amongst others—product heterogeneity. In general, inputs grouped together are more easily substitutable among themselves than with other elements outside the nest. For example, imports can more easily be substituted in terms of foreign production source, rather than between domestic production and one specific foreign country of origin. Analogously, composite energy inputs are more substitutable with capital than with other factors.A representative consumer in each region receives income, defined as the service value of national primary factors (natural resources, land, labour, capital). Capital and labour are perfectly mobile domestically but immobile internationally. Land and natural resources, on the other hand, are industry-specific. This income is then used to finance three classes of expenditure: aggregate household consumption, public consumption and savings as depicted in the Fig. 7.Fig. 7ICES nested tree structure for final demandFull size image Thus, the upper level represented in Fig. 7, mathematically translates into a Cobb-Douglas utility constrained maximization problem:$$\\\\begin{aligned} \\\\max U= & {} C\\\\mathop \\\\prod \\\\limits _i U_i^{B_i } \\\\\\\\ subject \\\\,to\\\\, X= & {} \\\\mathop \\\\sum \\\\limits _i E_i \\\\left( {P_i ,U_i } \\\\right) \\\\end{aligned}$$where \\\\(U_{i}\\\\) are the per capita utility from private consumption, per capita utility from government consumption, and per capita real savings; C is a scaling factor and \\\\(B_{i}\\\\) are distribution parameters. X describes the budget constraint which must meet the sum of three types of expenditures \\\\(E_{i}\\\\). \\\\(P_{i}\\\\) is the expenditure-share-weighted index of commodity group price indices.At the second level, per capita utility from private consumption is derived from the aggregation of per capita private consumption of individual commodities. This is done using the Hanoch’s constant difference elasticity (CDE) demand system (Hanoch 1975).$$\\\\begin{aligned} 1=\\\\mathop \\\\sum \\\\limits _i B_i U^{\\\\Upsilon _i R_i }\\\\left( {\\\\frac{P_i }{X}} \\\\right) ^{\\\\Upsilon _i } \\\\end{aligned}$$where U denotes utility, \\\\(P_{i}\\\\) the price of commodity i, X the expenditure, \\\\(B_{i}\\\\) are distribution parameters, \\\\(Y_{i}\\\\) substitution parameters, and \\\\(R_{i}\\\\) expansion parameters.1.2 Endogenous DynamicsICES model is a recursive dynamic model. This means it presents a sequence of static equilibria which are inter-temporally connected by the process of capital accumulation. Capital growth is standard along exogenous growth theory models and follows:$$\\\\begin{aligned} Ke_r =I_r +\\\\left( {1-\\\\delta } \\\\right) Kb_r \\\\end{aligned}$$where Ke \\\\(_{r}\\\\) is the “end of period” capital stock, Kb \\\\(_{r}\\\\) is the “beginning of period” capital stock, \\\\(\\\\delta \\\\) is capital depreciation and \\\\(I_{r}\\\\) is endogenous investment. Once the model is solved at a given step t, the value of Ke \\\\(_{r}\\\\) is stored in an external file and used as the “beginning of period” capital stock of the subsequent step \\\\(t+1\\\\).The hearth of the model’s dynamics is the endogenous determination of investment demand \\\\(I_{r}\\\\). Sources of world investments are savings from households. Regional households save a given share of their income which is firstly “pooled” by a “world bank” and then redistributed back to each region following:$$\\\\begin{aligned} I_r =\\\\varphi _r RGDP_r e^{\\\\left[ \\\\left( {\\\\rho _r \\\\left( {R_r^E -R^{w}} \\\\right) } \\\\right. \\\\right] } \\\\end{aligned}$$where RGDP is real GDP, \\\\(\\\\rho _{r}\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\varphi _{r}\\\\) are given parameters, \\\\(R_{r}^{E}\\\\) and \\\\(R^{W}\\\\) are the expected rate of return to capital in region r and the world rate of return to capital respectively. According to the previous equation, each region demands investment as long as its real GDP rises or its expected rate of return is higher than the world rate of return \\\\(R^{W}\\\\). Investment demand is negatively correlated to \\\\(R^{W}\\\\) which on its turn is determined by the general equilibrium condition requiring equalization between global savings and investments. The parameter \\\\(\\\\rho _{r}\\\\) reflects the flexibility of capital movement related to changes in the current rate of return. If \\\\(\\\\rho _{r}\\\\) has a small value then it will reduce the effect of the growth of the current rate of return when compared with the growth of the global rate of return; basically it can be assumed to reflect policy restrictions. \\\\(R_{r}^{E}\\\\) needs a particular comment: ICES does not generate endogenously the expected rate of return to capital according to a fully rational expectation generation process of a forward looking agent; more simply it is assumed that the expected rate of return to capital coincides with the current observed rate of return to capital.The world investment supply (savings) must match world investment demand, but this is not necessarily so at the regional level. Indeed a region can run a foreign debt or credit position as long as Sr \\\\(\\\\ne \\\\) Ir. This will be reflected in disequilibrium in the trade balance.In ICES model, also the stock of natural resource has an endogenous dynamics. As explained in Hertel et al. (2008), initial calibration values of these variables in the original GTAP database are not obtained from official statistics, but are indirectly estimated to make the model consistent with industry supply elasticity values from the literature. Then to represent in ICES availability of additional resources due to new discoveries, the price of natural resources has been fixed exogenously, making it variable over time in line with exogenous projections, while allowing the model to compute endogenously the corresponding stock levels.1.3 Exogenous DynamicsCapital and natural resources are not the only factors expected to vary over time. Population stock, labour stock, labour and land productivity change over time because of natural or technological evolutionary processes. These processes have been also taken into account in the baseline. This has been done by updating exogenously year by year the initial calibration data of all the above mentioned variables according to their expected rates of change.1.4 GTAP DatabaseThe model and database are calibrated for year 2004, which constitutes also the beginning year for simulations. ICES model relies on GTAP 7 Data Base (Narayanan and Walmsley 2008) with world coverage: countries are aggregated in 113 macro-regions, and all economic sectors, grouped in 57 sectors.Furthermore, the database and the model account for main GHG emissions \\\\(\\\\hbox {CO}_{2}, \\\\hbox {CH}_{4}\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\hbox {N}_{2}\\\\hbox {O}\\\\). Following Burniaux and Truong (2002), \\\\(\\\\hbox {CO}_{2}\\\\) emissions are calculated proportionally to energy combustion. Data relative to energy volumes are also included in the GTAP 7 Data Base. Emissions of other greenhouse gases, namely methane and nitrous oxide, are also included in ICES. Data relative with emissions of these gases have been calculated starting from the GTAP \\\\(\\\\hbox {non-CO}_{2}\\\\) emissions database (Lee 2003).Rights and permissionsReprints and permissionsAbout this articleCite this articleBosello, F., Campagnolo, L., Cervigni, R. et al.

The evaluation is performed by shocking land productivity in a computable general equilibrium model tailored to replicate Nigerian economic development up to 2050. The detail of land uses in the model has been increased by differentiating land types per agro-ecological zones. Uncertainty about future climate is captured, using, as inputs, yield changes computed by a crop model under ten general circulation models runs. Climate change turns out to be negative for Nigeria in the medium term, with production losses and increase in crop prices, higher food dependency on foreign imports, and GDP losses in all the simulations after 2025. In a second part of the paper, a cost effectiveness analysis of adaptation in Nigerian agriculture is conducted. The adaptation practices considered are a mix of cheaper “soft measures” and more costly “hard” irrigation expansion. The main result is that the cost effectiveness of the whole package depends crucially on the possibility of implementing adaptation by exploiting low-cost opportunities which show a benefit-cost ratio larger than one in all the climate regimes.

The study therefore assumes its uniform development.The CMCC-MED global model is the reference GCM for the COSMO-CLM model (Scoccimarro et al. 2011).Regional Climate Models are defined as limited-area models which are used to dynamically ‘downscale’, global model simulations for some particular geographical region to provide more detailed information, Flato et al. (2013)”.The 10 GCMs considered are all reproducing the A1B scenario. This scenario is under A1 storyline, which describes a world characterised by high economic growth and regional convergence, but we assumed a balanced use of fossil and non-fossil energy sources proper of A1B scenario (Nakicenovic et al. 2000). We consider this storyline consistent economic scenario described in the “Nigeria Vision 20:2020” (FGN 2010): high GDP growth, decreasing VA share of agricultural sector, and increasing VA share of services.In our analysis, we account only for the uncertainty due to the choice of the climate model. We are not considering the uncertainty due to emission scenarios, which is limited in the medium term according to the literature (Lionello 2012). Furthermore, the uncertainty related to the choice of the crop and the economic model is also disregarded.Among the 10 GCM simulation considered, 9 comes from the Couple Models Intercomparison Project 3 (http://www-pcmdi.llnl.gov/ipcc/about_ipcc.php): CNRM_CM3, CSIRO_Mk3.5, GFDL_cm2.1, IAP_FGOALS, CCSR_MIROC3.2, MPI_ECHAM5, MRI_CGCM_2.3.2, NCAR_CCSM3, and UKMO_HadCM3. The last simulation is from the CMCC-MED global model (0.75 \\\\(^{\\\\circ }\\\\) resolution).Nonetheless, for completeness of information, production changes of these crops are also reported. But they depend upon changes in relative prices and are not directly imputable to climate-induced yield changes.Note that the drop in production also affects the other two crop aggregates, “vegetables and fruits” and “other crops” which are not directly concerned by the yield decline. This is due to a general contraction of the Nigerian economy in the climate change scenario. Bosello et al. (2007) noted that this procedure represents adaptation as a pure cost, neglecting the potential multiplicative effects of adaptation investment on the economy. They thus propose to trade off adaptation investment with consumption rather than with other investments. We will test this alternative formulation in a subsequent paper.For further details about ICES model, please visit the website: http://www.icesmodel.feem.it/.ReferencesAvetisyan M, Baldos U, Hertel T (2011) Development of the GTAP version 7 land use data base.

Industries are “typically” modelled through a representative cost-minimizing firm, taking input prices as given. In turn, output prices are given by average production costs. The production functions are specified via a series of nested CES functions. Peculiar to ICES is the “isolation” in the production tree of energy factors which are taken out from the set of intermediate inputs and are inserted as primary production factors in a nested level of substitution with capital. The following figure shows the production structure of the model.Fig. 6ICES nested production functionFull size image At the top of Fig. 6, production stems from the combination of intermediate inputs (QF) and a value added composite including all primary factors and energy (QVAEN). Perfect complementarity is assumed between value added and intermediates. This implies the adoption a Leontief production function. For sector i in region r final supply (output) results from the following constrained production cost minimization problem for the producer:$$\\\\begin{aligned}&\\\\min PVAEN_{i,r} QVAEN_{i,r} +PF_{i,r} QF_{i,r} \\\\\\\\&s.t. \\\\,Y_{i,r} =\\\\min \\\\left[ QVAEN_{i,r} ,QF_{i,r} \\\\right] \\\\end{aligned}$$where PVAEN and PF are prices of the related production factors.The second nested-level in Fig. 6 represents, on the left hand side, the value added plus energy composite (QVAEN). This composite stems from a CES function that combines four primary factors: land (QLAND), natural resources (QFE), labour (QFE) and the capital-energy bundle (QKE) using \\\\(\\\\sigma \\\\)VAE as elasticity of substitution. Primary factor demand on its turn derives from the first order conditions of the following constrained cost minimization problem for the representative firm:$$\\\\begin{aligned}&\\\\min P_{i,r}^{Land} LAND_{i,r} +P_{i,r}^{NR} NR_{i,r} +P_{i,r}^L L_{i,r} +P_{i,r}^{KE} KE_{i,r} \\\\\\\\&s.t.\\\\, QVAEN_{i,r,t} =\\\\left. {\\\\left( {LAND_{i,r}^{\\\\frac{\\\\sigma _{VAE} -1}{\\\\sigma _{VAE} }} +NR_{i,r}^{\\\\frac{\\\\sigma _{VAE} -1}{\\\\sigma _{VAE} }} +L_{i,r}^{\\\\frac{\\\\sigma _{VAE} -1}{\\\\sigma _{VAE} }} +KE_{i,r}^{\\\\frac{\\\\sigma _{VAE} -1}{\\\\sigma _{VAE} }} } \\\\right. } \\\\right) ^{\\\\frac{\\\\sigma _{VAE} }{\\\\sigma _{VAE} -1}} \\\\end{aligned}$$In the third nested-level, the QLAND bundle combines the AEZ-specific land types and the KE bundle combines capital with a set of different energy inputs. This is a peculiarity of GTAP-E and ICES model. In fact, energy inputs are not part of the intermediates, but are combined to capital in a specific composite.Furthermore, Energy is produced using Electric and Non Electric commodities in the Fourth nested-level, while the Non Electric commodity is produced using Coal and Otherfuel commodities. At the basic level of the production tree, there are Gas, Oil, Petroleum Products and Biofuels.Notice that domestic and foreign inputs are not perfect substitutes, according to the so-called “Armington assumption”, which accounts for—amongst others—product heterogeneity. In general, inputs grouped together are more easily substitutable among themselves than with other elements outside the nest. For example, imports can more easily be substituted in terms of foreign production source, rather than between domestic production and one specific foreign country of origin. Analogously, composite energy inputs are more substitutable with capital than with other factors.A representative consumer in each region receives income, defined as the service value of national primary factors (natural resources, land, labour, capital). Capital and labour are perfectly mobile domestically but immobile internationally. Land and natural resources, on the other hand, are industry-specific. This income is then used to finance three classes of expenditure: aggregate household consumption, public consumption and savings as depicted in the Fig. 7.Fig. 7ICES nested tree structure for final demandFull size image Thus, the upper level represented in Fig. 7, mathematically translates into a Cobb-Douglas utility constrained maximization problem:$$\\\\begin{aligned} \\\\max U= & {} C\\\\mathop \\\\prod \\\\limits _i U_i^{B_i } \\\\\\\\ subject \\\\,to\\\\, X= & {} \\\\mathop \\\\sum \\\\limits _i E_i \\\\left( {P_i ,U_i } \\\\right) \\\\end{aligned}$$where \\\\(U_{i}\\\\) are the per capita utility from private consumption, per capita utility from government consumption, and per capita real savings; C is a scaling factor and \\\\(B_{i}\\\\) are distribution parameters. X describes the budget constraint which must meet the sum of three types of expenditures \\\\(E_{i}\\\\). \\\\(P_{i}\\\\) is the expenditure-share-weighted index of commodity group price indices.At the second level, per capita utility from private consumption is derived from the aggregation of per capita private consumption of individual commodities. This is done using the Hanoch’s constant difference elasticity (CDE) demand system (Hanoch 1975).$$\\\\begin{aligned} 1=\\\\mathop \\\\sum \\\\limits _i B_i U^{\\\\Upsilon _i R_i }\\\\left( {\\\\frac{P_i }{X}} \\\\right) ^{\\\\Upsilon _i } \\\\end{aligned}$$where U denotes utility, \\\\(P_{i}\\\\) the price of commodity i, X the expenditure, \\\\(B_{i}\\\\) are distribution parameters, \\\\(Y_{i}\\\\) substitution parameters, and \\\\(R_{i}\\\\) expansion parameters.1.2 Endogenous DynamicsICES model is a recursive dynamic model. This means it presents a sequence of static equilibria which are inter-temporally connected by the process of capital accumulation. Capital growth is standard along exogenous growth theory models and follows:$$\\\\begin{aligned} Ke_r =I_r +\\\\left( {1-\\\\delta } \\\\right) Kb_r \\\\end{aligned}$$where Ke \\\\(_{r}\\\\) is the “end of period” capital stock, Kb \\\\(_{r}\\\\) is the “beginning of period” capital stock, \\\\(\\\\delta \\\\) is capital depreciation and \\\\(I_{r}\\\\) is endogenous investment. Once the model is solved at a given step t, the value of Ke \\\\(_{r}\\\\) is stored in an external file and used as the “beginning of period” capital stock of the subsequent step \\\\(t+1\\\\).The hearth of the model’s dynamics is the endogenous determination of investment demand \\\\(I_{r}\\\\). Sources of world investments are savings from households. Regional households save a given share of their income which is firstly “pooled” by a “world bank” and then redistributed back to each region following:$$\\\\begin{aligned} I_r =\\\\varphi _r RGDP_r e^{\\\\left[ \\\\left( {\\\\rho _r \\\\left( {R_r^E -R^{w}} \\\\right) } \\\\right. \\\\right] } \\\\end{aligned}$$where RGDP is real GDP, \\\\(\\\\rho _{r}\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\varphi _{r}\\\\) are given parameters, \\\\(R_{r}^{E}\\\\) and \\\\(R^{W}\\\\) are the expected rate of return to capital in region r and the world rate of return to capital respectively. According to the previous equation, each region demands investment as long as its real GDP rises or its expected rate of return is higher than the world rate of return \\\\(R^{W}\\\\). Investment demand is negatively correlated to \\\\(R^{W}\\\\) which on its turn is determined by the general equilibrium condition requiring equalization between global savings and investments. The parameter \\\\(\\\\rho _{r}\\\\) reflects the flexibility of capital movement related to changes in the current rate of return. If \\\\(\\\\rho _{r}\\\\) has a small value then it will reduce the effect of the growth of the current rate of return when compared with the growth of the global rate of return; basically it can be assumed to reflect policy restrictions. \\\\(R_{r}^{E}\\\\) needs a particular comment: ICES does not generate endogenously the expected rate of return to capital according to a fully rational expectation generation process of a forward looking agent; more simply it is assumed that the expected rate of return to capital coincides with the current observed rate of return to capital.The world investment supply (savings) must match world investment demand, but this is not necessarily so at the regional level. Indeed a region can run a foreign debt or credit position as long as Sr \\\\(\\\\ne \\\\) Ir. This will be reflected in disequilibrium in the trade balance.In ICES model, also the stock of natural resource has an endogenous dynamics. As explained in Hertel et al. (2008), initial calibration values of these variables in the original GTAP database are not obtained from official statistics, but are indirectly estimated to make the model consistent with industry supply elasticity values from the literature. Then to represent in ICES availability of additional resources due to new discoveries, the price of natural resources has been fixed exogenously, making it variable over time in line with exogenous projections, while allowing the model to compute endogenously the corresponding stock levels.1.3 Exogenous DynamicsCapital and natural resources are not the only factors expected to vary over time. Population stock, labour stock, labour and land productivity change over time because of natural or technological evolutionary processes. These processes have been also taken into account in the baseline. This has been done by updating exogenously year by year the initial calibration data of all the above mentioned variables according to their expected rates of change.1.4 GTAP DatabaseThe model and database are calibrated for year 2004, which constitutes also the beginning year for simulations. ICES model relies on GTAP 7 Data Base (Narayanan and Walmsley 2008) with world coverage: countries are aggregated in 113 macro-regions, and all economic sectors, grouped in 57 sectors.Furthermore, the database and the model account for main GHG emissions \\\\(\\\\hbox {CO}_{2}, \\\\hbox {CH}_{4}\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\hbox {N}_{2}\\\\hbox {O}\\\\). Following Burniaux and Truong (2002), \\\\(\\\\hbox {CO}_{2}\\\\) emissions are calculated proportionally to energy combustion. Data relative to energy volumes are also included in the GTAP 7 Data Base. Emissions of other greenhouse gases, namely methane and nitrous oxide, are also included in ICES. Data relative with emissions of these gases have been calculated starting from the GTAP \\\\(\\\\hbox {non-CO}_{2}\\\\) emissions database (Lee 2003).Rights and permissionsReprints and permissionsAbout this articleCite this articleBosello, F., Campagnolo, L., Cervigni, R. et al.

The evaluation is performed by shocking land productivity in a computable general equilibrium model tailored to replicate Nigerian economic development up to 2050. The detail of land uses in the model has been increased by differentiating land types per agro-ecological zones. Uncertainty about future climate is captured, using, as inputs, yield changes computed by a crop model under ten general circulation models runs. Climate change turns out to be negative for Nigeria in the medium term, with production losses and increase in crop prices, higher food dependency on foreign imports, and GDP losses in all the simulations after 2025. In a second part of the paper, a cost effectiveness analysis of adaptation in Nigerian agriculture is conducted. The adaptation practices considered are a mix of cheaper “soft measures” and more costly “hard” irrigation expansion. The main result is that the cost effectiveness of the whole package depends crucially on the possibility of implementing adaptation by exploiting low-cost opportunities which show a benefit-cost ratio larger than one in all the climate regimes.\\nThe present research offers an economic assessment of climate change impacts on the four major crop families characterizing Nigerian agriculture.

The study therefore assumes its uniform development.The CMCC-MED global model is the reference GCM for the COSMO-CLM model (Scoccimarro et al. 2011).Regional Climate Models are defined as limited-area models which are used to dynamically ‘downscale’, global model simulations for some particular geographical region to provide more detailed information, Flato et al. (2013)”.The 10 GCMs considered are all reproducing the A1B scenario. This scenario is under A1 storyline, which describes a world characterised by high economic growth and regional convergence, but we assumed a balanced use of fossil and non-fossil energy sources proper of A1B scenario (Nakicenovic et al. 2000). We consider this storyline consistent economic scenario described in the “Nigeria Vision 20:2020” (FGN 2010): high GDP growth, decreasing VA share of agricultural sector, and increasing VA share of services.In our analysis, we account only for the uncertainty due to the choice of the climate model. We are not considering the uncertainty due to emission scenarios, which is limited in the medium term according to the literature (Lionello 2012). Furthermore, the uncertainty related to the choice of the crop and the economic model is also disregarded.Among the 10 GCM simulation considered, 9 comes from the Couple Models Intercomparison Project 3 (http://www-pcmdi.llnl.gov/ipcc/about_ipcc.php): CNRM_CM3, CSIRO_Mk3.5, GFDL_cm2.1, IAP_FGOALS, CCSR_MIROC3.2, MPI_ECHAM5, MRI_CGCM_2.3.2, NCAR_CCSM3, and UKMO_HadCM3. The last simulation is from the CMCC-MED global model (0.75 \\\\(^{\\\\circ }\\\\) resolution).Nonetheless, for completeness of information, production changes of these crops are also reported. But they depend upon changes in relative prices and are not directly imputable to climate-induced yield changes.Note that the drop in production also affects the other two crop aggregates, “vegetables and fruits” and “other crops” which are not directly concerned by the yield decline. This is due to a general contraction of the Nigerian economy in the climate change scenario. Bosello et al. (2007) noted that this procedure represents adaptation as a pure cost, neglecting the potential multiplicative effects of adaptation investment on the economy. They thus propose to trade off adaptation investment with consumption rather than with other investments. We will test this alternative formulation in a subsequent paper.For further details about ICES model, please visit the website: http://www.icesmodel.feem.it/.\\nFor additional documentation about model description and application of ICES, the interested reader is also addressed to: http://www.feem.it/getpage.aspx?id=138&sez=Research&padre=18&sub=75&idsub=102.The agricultural sectors considered in GTAP 7 database are paddy rice, wheat, cereal grains, vegetables and fruits, oil seeds, sugar cane, plant based fibres, and other crops.Cassava and yam are the most important crops in terms of share of agricultural value added, building up in 2006 respectively the 16.3 and the 14.7% of it (Nwafor et al. 2010).We assume neither an increase/reduction of harvested area due for example to a reduction/increase of pastureland or build-up land, nor an increase/reduction of the number of harvests per year.Information on future irrigated land per crop and AEZ is not available.

Intertemporal Computable Equilibrium System (ICES) modelFootnote 14 is multi-regional CGE model of the world economy, built upon the static GTAP-E model (Burniaux and Truong 2002), which in turn is an extension of the basic GTAP model (Hertel 1997). Industries are “typically” modelled through a representative cost-minimizing firm, taking input prices as given. In turn, output prices are given by average production costs. The production functions are specified via a series of nested CES functions. Peculiar to ICES is the “isolation” in the production tree of energy factors which are taken out from the set of intermediate inputs and are inserted as primary production factors in a nested level of substitution with capital. The following figure shows the production structure of the model.Fig. 6ICES nested production functionFull size image At the top of Fig. 6, production stems from the combination of intermediate inputs (QF) and a value added composite including all primary factors and energy (QVAEN). Perfect complementarity is assumed between value added and intermediates. This implies the adoption a Leontief production function. For sector i in region r final supply (output) results from the following constrained production cost minimization problem for the producer:$$\\\\begin{aligned}&\\\\min PVAEN_{i,r} QVAEN_{i,r} +PF_{i,r} QF_{i,r} \\\\\\\\&s.t. \\\\,Y_{i,r} =\\\\min \\\\left[ QVAEN_{i,r} ,QF_{i,r} \\\\right] \\\\end{aligned}$$where PVAEN and PF are prices of the related production factors.The second nested-level in Fig. 6 represents, on the left hand side, the value added plus energy composite (QVAEN). This composite stems from a CES function that combines four primary factors: land (QLAND), natural resources (QFE), labour (QFE) and the capital-energy bundle (QKE) using \\\\(\\\\sigma \\\\)VAE as elasticity of substitution. Primary factor demand on its turn derives from the first order conditions of the following constrained cost minimization problem for the representative firm:$$\\\\begin{aligned}&\\\\min P_{i,r}^{Land} LAND_{i,r} +P_{i,r}^{NR} NR_{i,r} +P_{i,r}^L L_{i,r} +P_{i,r}^{KE} KE_{i,r} \\\\\\\\&s.t.\\\\, QVAEN_{i,r,t} =\\\\left. {\\\\left( {LAND_{i,r}^{\\\\frac{\\\\sigma _{VAE} -1}{\\\\sigma _{VAE} }} +NR_{i,r}^{\\\\frac{\\\\sigma _{VAE} -1}{\\\\sigma _{VAE} }} +L_{i,r}^{\\\\frac{\\\\sigma _{VAE} -1}{\\\\sigma _{VAE} }} +KE_{i,r}^{\\\\frac{\\\\sigma _{VAE} -1}{\\\\sigma _{VAE} }} } \\\\right. } \\\\right) ^{\\\\frac{\\\\sigma _{VAE} }{\\\\sigma _{VAE} -1}} \\\\end{aligned}$$In the third nested-level, the QLAND bundle combines the AEZ-specific land types and the KE bundle combines capital with a set of different energy inputs. This is a peculiarity of GTAP-E and ICES model. In fact, energy inputs are not part of the intermediates, but are combined to capital in a specific composite.Furthermore, Energy is produced using Electric and Non Electric commodities in the Fourth nested-level, while the Non Electric commodity is produced using Coal and Otherfuel commodities. At the basic level of the production tree, there are Gas, Oil, Petroleum Products and Biofuels.Notice that domestic and foreign inputs are not perfect substitutes, according to the so-called “Armington assumption”, which accounts for—amongst others—product heterogeneity. In general, inputs grouped together are more easily substitutable among themselves than with other elements outside the nest. For example, imports can more easily be substituted in terms of foreign production source, rather than between domestic production and one specific foreign country of origin. Analogously, composite energy inputs are more substitutable with capital than with other factors.A representative consumer in each region receives income, defined as the service value of national primary factors (natural resources, land, labour, capital). Capital and labour are perfectly mobile domestically but immobile internationally. Land and natural resources, on the other hand, are industry-specific. This income is then used to finance three classes of expenditure: aggregate household consumption, public consumption and savings as depicted in the Fig. 7.Fig. 7ICES nested tree structure for final demandFull size image Thus, the upper level represented in Fig. 7, mathematically translates into a Cobb-Douglas utility constrained maximization problem:$$\\\\begin{aligned} \\\\max U= & {} C\\\\mathop \\\\prod \\\\limits _i U_i^{B_i } \\\\\\\\ subject \\\\,to\\\\, X= & {} \\\\mathop \\\\sum \\\\limits _i E_i \\\\left( {P_i ,U_i } \\\\right) \\\\end{aligned}$$where \\\\(U_{i}\\\\) are the per capita utility from private consumption, per capita utility from government consumption, and per capita real savings; C is a scaling factor and \\\\(B_{i}\\\\) are distribution parameters. X describes the budget constraint which must meet the sum of three types of expenditures \\\\(E_{i}\\\\). \\\\(P_{i}\\\\) is the expenditure-share-weighted index of commodity group price indices.At the second level, per capita utility from private consumption is derived from the aggregation of per capita private consumption of individual commodities. This is done using the Hanoch’s constant difference elasticity (CDE) demand system (Hanoch 1975).$$\\\\begin{aligned} 1=\\\\mathop \\\\sum \\\\limits _i B_i U^{\\\\Upsilon _i R_i }\\\\left( {\\\\frac{P_i }{X}} \\\\right) ^{\\\\Upsilon _i } \\\\end{aligned}$$where U denotes utility, \\\\(P_{i}\\\\) the price of commodity i, X the expenditure, \\\\(B_{i}\\\\) are distribution parameters, \\\\(Y_{i}\\\\) substitution parameters, and \\\\(R_{i}\\\\) expansion parameters.1.2 Endogenous DynamicsICES model is a recursive dynamic model. This means it presents a sequence of static equilibria which are inter-temporally connected by the process of capital accumulation. Capital growth is standard along exogenous growth theory models and follows:$$\\\\begin{aligned} Ke_r =I_r +\\\\left( {1-\\\\delta } \\\\right) Kb_r \\\\end{aligned}$$where Ke \\\\(_{r}\\\\) is the “end of period” capital stock, Kb \\\\(_{r}\\\\) is the “beginning of period” capital stock, \\\\(\\\\delta \\\\) is capital depreciation and \\\\(I_{r}\\\\) is endogenous investment. Once the model is solved at a given step t, the value of Ke \\\\(_{r}\\\\) is stored in an external file and used as the “beginning of period” capital stock of the subsequent step \\\\(t+1\\\\).The hearth of the model’s dynamics is the endogenous determination of investment demand \\\\(I_{r}\\\\). Sources of world investments are savings from households. Regional households save a given share of their income which is firstly “pooled” by a “world bank” and then redistributed back to each region following:$$\\\\begin{aligned} I_r =\\\\varphi _r RGDP_r e^{\\\\left[ \\\\left( {\\\\rho _r \\\\left( {R_r^E -R^{w}} \\\\right) } \\\\right. \\\\right] } \\\\end{aligned}$$where RGDP is real GDP, \\\\(\\\\rho _{r}\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\varphi _{r}\\\\) are given parameters, \\\\(R_{r}^{E}\\\\) and \\\\(R^{W}\\\\) are the expected rate of return to capital in region r and the world rate of return to capital respectively. According to the previous equation, each region demands investment as long as its real GDP rises or its expected rate of return is higher than the world rate of return \\\\(R^{W}\\\\). Investment demand is negatively correlated to \\\\(R^{W}\\\\) which on its turn is determined by the general equilibrium condition requiring equalization between global savings and investments. The parameter \\\\(\\\\rho _{r}\\\\) reflects the flexibility of capital movement related to changes in the current rate of return. If \\\\(\\\\rho _{r}\\\\) has a small value then it will reduce the effect of the growth of the current rate of return when compared with the growth of the global rate of return; basically it can be assumed to reflect policy restrictions. \\\\(R_{r}^{E}\\\\) needs a particular comment: ICES does not generate endogenously the expected rate of return to capital according to a fully rational expectation generation process of a forward looking agent; more simply it is assumed that the expected rate of return to capital coincides with the current observed rate of return to capital.The world investment supply (savings) must match world investment demand, but this is not necessarily so at the regional level. Indeed a region can run a foreign debt or credit position as long as Sr \\\\(\\\\ne \\\\) Ir. This will be reflected in disequilibrium in the trade balance.In ICES model, also the stock of natural resource has an endogenous dynamics. As explained in Hertel et al. (2008), initial calibration values of these variables in the original GTAP database are not obtained from official statistics, but are indirectly estimated to make the model consistent with industry supply elasticity values from the literature. Then to represent in ICES availability of additional resources due to new discoveries, the price of natural resources has been fixed exogenously, making it variable over time in line with exogenous projections, while allowing the model to compute endogenously the corresponding stock levels.1.3 Exogenous DynamicsCapital and natural resources are not the only factors expected to vary over time. Population stock, labour stock, labour and land productivity change over time because of natural or technological evolutionary processes. These processes have been also taken into account in the baseline. This has been done by updating exogenously year by year the initial calibration data of all the above mentioned variables according to their expected rates of change.1.4 GTAP DatabaseThe model and database are calibrated for year 2004, which constitutes also the beginning year for simulations. ICES model relies on GTAP 7 Data Base (Narayanan and Walmsley 2008) with world coverage: countries are aggregated in 113 macro-regions, and all economic sectors, grouped in 57 sectors.Furthermore, the database and the model account for main GHG emissions \\\\(\\\\hbox {CO}_{2}, \\\\hbox {CH}_{4}\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\hbox {N}_{2}\\\\hbox {O}\\\\). Following Burniaux and Truong (2002), \\\\(\\\\hbox {CO}_{2}\\\\) emissions are calculated proportionally to energy combustion. Data relative to energy volumes are also included in the GTAP 7 Data Base. Emissions of other greenhouse gases, namely methane and nitrous oxide, are also included in ICES. Data relative with emissions of these gases have been calculated starting from the GTAP \\\\(\\\\hbox {non-CO}_{2}\\\\) emissions database (Lee 2003).\\nAppendix1.1 The Core of ICES ModelThe Intertemporal Computable Equilibrium System (ICES) modelFootnote 14 is multi-regional CGE model of the world economy, built upon the static GTAP-E model (Burniaux and Truong 2002), which in turn is an extension of the basic GTAP model (Hertel 1997).

This is done using the Hanoch’s constant difference elasticity (CDE) demand system (Hanoch 1975).$$\\\\begin{aligned} 1=\\\\mathop \\\\sum \\\\limits _i B_i U^{\\\\Upsilon _i R_i }\\\\left( {\\\\frac{P_i }{X}} \\\\right) ^{\\\\Upsilon _i } \\\\end{aligned}$$where U denotes utility, \\\\(P_{i}\\\\) the price of commodity i, X the expenditure, \\\\(B_{i}\\\\) are distribution parameters, \\\\(Y_{i}\\\\) substitution parameters, and \\\\(R_{i}\\\\) expansion parameters.1.2 Endogenous DynamicsICES model is a recursive dynamic model. This means it presents a sequence of static equilibria which are inter-temporally connected by the process of capital accumulation. Capital growth is standard along exogenous growth theory models and follows:$$\\\\begin{aligned} Ke_r =I_r +\\\\left( {1-\\\\delta } \\\\right) Kb_r \\\\end{aligned}$$where Ke \\\\(_{r}\\\\) is the “end of period” capital stock, Kb \\\\(_{r}\\\\) is the “beginning of period” capital stock, \\\\(\\\\delta \\\\) is capital depreciation and \\\\(I_{r}\\\\) is endogenous investment. Once the model is solved at a given step t, the value of Ke \\\\(_{r}\\\\) is stored in an external file and used as the “beginning of period” capital stock of the subsequent step \\\\(t+1\\\\).The hearth of the model’s dynamics is the endogenous determination of investment demand \\\\(I_{r}\\\\). Sources of world investments are savings from households. Regional households save a given share of their income which is firstly “pooled” by a “world bank” and then redistributed back to each region following:$$\\\\begin{aligned} I_r =\\\\varphi _r RGDP_r e^{\\\\left[ \\\\left( {\\\\rho _r \\\\left( {R_r^E -R^{w}} \\\\right) } \\\\right. \\\\right] } \\\\end{aligned}$$where RGDP is real GDP, \\\\(\\\\rho _{r}\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\varphi _{r}\\\\) are given parameters, \\\\(R_{r}^{E}\\\\) and \\\\(R^{W}\\\\) are the expected rate of return to capital in region r and the world rate of return to capital respectively. According to the previous equation, each region demands investment as long as its real GDP rises or its expected rate of return is higher than the world rate of return \\\\(R^{W}\\\\). Investment demand is negatively correlated to \\\\(R^{W}\\\\) which on its turn is determined by the general equilibrium condition requiring equalization between global savings and investments. The parameter \\\\(\\\\rho _{r}\\\\) reflects the flexibility of capital movement related to changes in the current rate of return. If \\\\(\\\\rho _{r}\\\\) has a small value then it will reduce the effect of the growth of the current rate of return when compared with the growth of the global rate of return; basically it can be assumed to reflect policy restrictions. \\\\(R_{r}^{E}\\\\) needs a particular comment: ICES does not generate endogenously the expected rate of return to capital according to a fully rational expectation generation process of a forward looking agent; more simply it is assumed that the expected rate of return to capital coincides with the current observed rate of return to capital.The world investment supply (savings) must match world investment demand, but this is not necessarily so at the regional level. Indeed a region can run a foreign debt or credit position as long as Sr \\\\(\\\\ne \\\\) Ir. This will be reflected in disequilibrium in the trade balance.In ICES model, also the stock of natural resource has an endogenous dynamics. As explained in Hertel et al. (2008), initial calibration values of these variables in the original GTAP database are not obtained from official statistics, but are indirectly estimated to make the model consistent with industry supply elasticity values from the literature. Then to represent in ICES availability of additional resources due to new discoveries, the price of natural resources has been fixed exogenously, making it variable over time in line with exogenous projections, while allowing the model to compute endogenously the corresponding stock levels.1.3 Exogenous DynamicsCapital and natural resources are not the only factors expected to vary over time. Population stock, labour stock, labour and land productivity change over time because of natural or technological evolutionary processes. These processes have been also taken into account in the baseline. This has been done by updating exogenously year by year the initial calibration data of all the above mentioned variables according to their expected rates of change.1.4 GTAP DatabaseThe model and database are calibrated for year 2004, which constitutes also the beginning year for simulations. ICES model relies on GTAP 7 Data Base (Narayanan and Walmsley 2008) with world coverage: countries are aggregated in 113 macro-regions, and all economic sectors, grouped in 57 sectors.Furthermore, the database and the model account for main GHG emissions \\\\(\\\\hbox {CO}_{2}, \\\\hbox {CH}_{4}\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\hbox {N}_{2}\\\\hbox {O}\\\\). Following Burniaux and Truong (2002), \\\\(\\\\hbox {CO}_{2}\\\\) emissions are calculated proportionally to energy combustion. Data relative to energy volumes are also included in the GTAP 7 Data Base. Emissions of other greenhouse gases, namely methane and nitrous oxide, are also included in ICES. Data relative with emissions of these gases have been calculated starting from the GTAP \\\\(\\\\hbox {non-CO}_{2}\\\\) emissions database (Lee 2003).\\n1.1 The Core of ICES Model\\nThe Intertemporal Computable Equilibrium System (ICES) modelFootnote 14 is multi-regional CGE model of the world economy, built upon the static GTAP-E model (Burniaux and Truong 2002), which in turn is an extension of the basic GTAP model (Hertel 1997). Industries are “typically” modelled through a representative cost-minimizing firm, taking input prices as given. In turn, output prices are given by average production costs. The production functions are specified via a series of nested CES functions. Peculiar to ICES is the “isolation” in the production tree of energy factors which are taken out from the set of intermediate inputs and are inserted as primary production factors in a nested level of substitution with capital. The following figure shows the production structure of the model.\\nFig. 6ICES nested production functionFull size image\\nICES nested production function\\nICES nested production function\\nICES nested production function\\nFull size image\\nFull size image\\nAt the top of Fig. 6, production stems from the combination of intermediate inputs (QF) and a value added composite including all primary factors and energy (QVAEN). Perfect complementarity is assumed between value added and intermediates. This implies the adoption a Leontief production function. For sector i in region r final supply (output) results from the following constrained production cost minimization problem for the producer:\\n$$\\\\begin{aligned}&\\\\min PVAEN_{i,r} QVAEN_{i,r} +PF_{i,r} QF_{i,r} \\\\\\\\&s.t. \\\\,Y_{i,r} =\\\\min \\\\left[ QVAEN_{i,r} ,QF_{i,r} \\\\right] \\\\end{aligned}$$\\n$$\\\\begin{aligned}&\\\\min PVAEN_{i,r} QVAEN_{i,r} +PF_{i,r} QF_{i,r} \\\\\\\\&s.t. \\\\,Y_{i,r} =\\\\min \\\\left[ QVAEN_{i,r} ,QF_{i,r} \\\\right] \\\\end{aligned}$$\\n$$\\\\begin{aligned}&\\\\min PVAEN_{i,r} QVAEN_{i,r} +PF_{i,r} QF_{i,r} \\\\\\\\&s.t. \\\\,Y_{i,r} =\\\\min \\\\left[ QVAEN_{i,r} ,QF_{i,r} \\\\right] \\\\end{aligned}$$\\nwhere PVAEN and PF are prices of the related production factors.\\nThe second nested-level in Fig. 6 represents, on the left hand side, the value added plus energy composite (QVAEN). This composite stems from a CES function that combines four primary factors: land (QLAND), natural resources (QFE), labour (QFE) and the capital-energy bundle (QKE) using \\\\(\\\\sigma \\\\)VAE as elasticity of substitution. Primary factor demand on its turn derives from the first order conditions of the following constrained cost minimization problem for the representative firm:\\n$$\\\\begin{aligned}&\\\\min P_{i,r}^{Land} LAND_{i,r} +P_{i,r}^{NR} NR_{i,r} +P_{i,r}^L L_{i,r} +P_{i,r}^{KE} KE_{i,r} \\\\\\\\&s.t.\\\\, QVAEN_{i,r,t} =\\\\left. {\\\\left( {LAND_{i,r}^{\\\\frac{\\\\sigma _{VAE} -1}{\\\\sigma _{VAE} }} +NR_{i,r}^{\\\\frac{\\\\sigma _{VAE} -1}{\\\\sigma _{VAE} }} +L_{i,r}^{\\\\frac{\\\\sigma _{VAE} -1}{\\\\sigma _{VAE} }} +KE_{i,r}^{\\\\frac{\\\\sigma _{VAE} -1}{\\\\sigma _{VAE} }} } \\\\right. } \\\\right) ^{\\\\frac{\\\\sigma _{VAE} }{\\\\sigma _{VAE} -1}} \\\\end{aligned}$$\\n$$\\\\begin{aligned}&\\\\min P_{i,r}^{Land} LAND_{i,r} +P_{i,r}^{NR} NR_{i,r} +P_{i,r}^L L_{i,r} +P_{i,r}^{KE} KE_{i,r} \\\\\\\\&s.t.\\\\, QVAEN_{i,r,t} =\\\\left. {\\\\left( {LAND_{i,r}^{\\\\frac{\\\\sigma _{VAE} -1}{\\\\sigma _{VAE} }} +NR_{i,r}^{\\\\frac{\\\\sigma _{VAE} -1}{\\\\sigma _{VAE} }} +L_{i,r}^{\\\\frac{\\\\sigma _{VAE} -1}{\\\\sigma _{VAE} }} +KE_{i,r}^{\\\\frac{\\\\sigma _{VAE} -1}{\\\\sigma _{VAE} }} } \\\\right. } \\\\right) ^{\\\\frac{\\\\sigma _{VAE} }{\\\\sigma _{VAE} -1}} \\\\end{aligned}$$\\n$$\\\\begin{aligned}&\\\\min P_{i,r}^{Land} LAND_{i,r} +P_{i,r}^{NR} NR_{i,r} +P_{i,r}^L L_{i,r} +P_{i,r}^{KE} KE_{i,r} \\\\\\\\&s.t.\\\\, QVAEN_{i,r,t} =\\\\left. {\\\\left( {LAND_{i,r}^{\\\\frac{\\\\sigma _{VAE} -1}{\\\\sigma _{VAE} }} +NR_{i,r}^{\\\\frac{\\\\sigma _{VAE} -1}{\\\\sigma _{VAE} }} +L_{i,r}^{\\\\frac{\\\\sigma _{VAE} -1}{\\\\sigma _{VAE} }} +KE_{i,r}^{\\\\frac{\\\\sigma _{VAE} -1}{\\\\sigma _{VAE} }} } \\\\right. } \\\\right) ^{\\\\frac{\\\\sigma _{VAE} }{\\\\sigma _{VAE} -1}} \\\\end{aligned}$$\\nIn the third nested-level, the QLAND bundle combines the AEZ-specific land types and the KE bundle combines capital with a set of different energy inputs. This is a peculiarity of GTAP-E and ICES model. In fact, energy inputs are not part of the intermediates, but are combined to capital in a specific composite.\\nFurthermore, Energy is produced using Electric and Non Electric commodities in the Fourth nested-level, while the Non Electric commodity is produced using Coal and Otherfuel commodities. At the basic level of the production tree, there are Gas, Oil, Petroleum Products and Biofuels.\\nNotice that domestic and foreign inputs are not perfect substitutes, according to the so-called “Armington assumption”, which accounts for—amongst others—product heterogeneity. In general, inputs grouped together are more easily substitutable among themselves than with other elements outside the nest. For example, imports can more easily be substituted in terms of foreign production source, rather than between domestic production and one specific foreign country of origin. Analogously, composite energy inputs are more substitutable with capital than with other factors.\\nA representative consumer in each region receives income, defined as the service value of national primary factors (natural resources, land, labour, capital). Capital and labour are perfectly mobile domestically but immobile internationally. Land and natural resources, on the other hand, are industry-specific. This income is then used to finance three classes of expenditure: aggregate household consumption, public consumption and savings as depicted in the Fig. 7.\\nFig. 7ICES nested tree structure for final demandFull size image\\nICES nested tree structure for final demand\\nICES nested tree structure for final demand\\nICES nested tree structure for final demand\\nFull size image\\nFull size image\\nThus, the upper level represented in Fig. 7, mathematically translates into a Cobb-Douglas utility constrained maximization problem:\\n$$\\\\begin{aligned} \\\\max U= & {} C\\\\mathop \\\\prod \\\\limits _i U_i^{B_i } \\\\\\\\ subject \\\\,to\\\\, X= & {} \\\\mathop \\\\sum \\\\limits _i E_i \\\\left( {P_i ,U_i } \\\\right) \\\\end{aligned}$$\\n$$\\\\begin{aligned} \\\\max U= & {} C\\\\mathop \\\\prod \\\\limits _i U_i^{B_i } \\\\\\\\ subject \\\\,to\\\\, X= & {} \\\\mathop \\\\sum \\\\limits _i E_i \\\\left( {P_i ,U_i } \\\\right) \\\\end{aligned}$$\\n$$\\\\begin{aligned} \\\\max U= & {} C\\\\mathop \\\\prod \\\\limits _i U_i^{B_i } \\\\\\\\ subject \\\\,to\\\\, X= & {} \\\\mathop \\\\sum \\\\limits _i E_i \\\\left( {P_i ,U_i } \\\\right) \\\\end{aligned}$$\\nwhere \\\\(U_{i}\\\\) are the per capita utility from private consumption, per capita utility from government consumption, and per capita real savings; C is a scaling factor and \\\\(B_{i}\\\\) are distribution parameters.

Tim-Ashama6 Part of the book series: Springer Climate ((SPCL)) 439 Accesses AbstractIn recent times, climate change has exacerbated agricultural production in Nigeria causing serious economic downturns and low food production of households. The study evaluated the impacts of climate change on sustainable crop production in Nigeria. Multi-stage random sampling was used to select 201 crop farmers who cultivated different crop types ranging from cassava, rice, yam, maize, etc., using structured questionnaire. Data obtained were analyzed using descriptive statistics such as the mean, frequency, and percentage and inferential statistics such as ordinary least square multiple regression technique. Results showed that 73.6% of the crop farmers were married, 50.7% females, and over 42.0% were relatively educated and experienced. A mean generated income of ₦172, 000 was estimated from the total sales of varieties of crops produced by the farmers in the state. Crops like rice, 7850.23 kg, cassava, 6492.41 kg, and maize, 6903.19 kg dominated the crop cultivation with higher mean outputs. Age, gender, household size, education, farming experience, farm size, and extension contacts were positive and significantly influenced crop production. Climate variables such as temperature, rainfall, number of rainy days were negative while sunshine hours and relative humidity were positive and both significantly influenced crop production in the state. Inadequate capital, land fragmentations, and inadequate information concerning climate change were perceived as major production and climatic constraints. Climate change should be technically mitigated to avert future negative consequences. Intensive awareness on climate change and provision of climate information and/or early warning signals to the knowledge of the crop farmers were recommended.

The study evaluated the impacts of climate change on sustainable crop production in Nigeria. Multi-stage random sampling was used to select 201 crop farmers who cultivated different crop types ranging from cassava, rice, yam, maize, etc., using structured questionnaire. Data obtained were analyzed using descriptive statistics such as the mean, frequency, and percentage and inferential statistics such as ordinary least square multiple regression technique. Results showed that 73.6% of the crop farmers were married, 50.7% females, and over 42.0% were relatively educated and experienced. A mean generated income of ₦172, 000 was estimated from the total sales of varieties of crops produced by the farmers in the state. Crops like rice, 7850.23 kg, cassava, 6492.41 kg, and maize, 6903.19 kg dominated the crop cultivation with higher mean outputs. Age, gender, household size, education, farming experience, farm size, and extension contacts were positive and significantly influenced crop production. Climate variables such as temperature, rainfall, number of rainy days were negative while sunshine hours and relative humidity were positive and both significantly influenced crop production in the state. Inadequate capital, land fragmentations, and inadequate information concerning climate change were perceived as major production and climatic constraints. Climate change should be technically mitigated to avert future negative consequences. Intensive awareness on climate change and provision of climate information and/or early warning signals to the knowledge of the crop farmers were recommended.

The study evaluated the impacts of climate change on sustainable crop production in Nigeria. Multi-stage random sampling was used to select 201 crop farmers who cultivated different crop types ranging from cassava, rice, yam, maize, etc., using structured questionnaire. Data obtained were analyzed using descriptive statistics such as the mean, frequency, and percentage and inferential statistics such as ordinary least square multiple regression technique. Results showed that 73.6% of the crop farmers were married, 50.7% females, and over 42.0% were relatively educated and experienced. A mean generated income of ₦172, 000 was estimated from the total sales of varieties of crops produced by the farmers in the state. Crops like rice, 7850.23 kg, cassava, 6492.41 kg, and maize, 6903.19 kg dominated the crop cultivation with higher mean outputs. Age, gender, household size, education, farming experience, farm size, and extension contacts were positive and significantly influenced crop production. Climate variables such as temperature, rainfall, number of rainy days were negative while sunshine hours and relative humidity were positive and both significantly influenced crop production in the state. Inadequate capital, land fragmentations, and inadequate information concerning climate change were perceived as major production and climatic constraints. Climate change should be technically mitigated to avert future negative consequences. Intensive awareness on climate change and provision of climate information and/or early warning signals to the knowledge of the crop farmers were recommended.\\nIn recent times, climate change has exacerbated agricultural production in Nigeria causing serious economic downturns and low food production of households.

Results showed that 73.6% of the crop farmers were married, 50.7% females, and over 42.0% were relatively educated and experienced. A mean generated income of ₦172, 000 was estimated from the total sales of varieties of crops produced by the farmers in the state. Crops like rice, 7850.23 kg, cassava, 6492.41 kg, and maize, 6903.19 kg dominated the crop cultivation with higher mean outputs. Age, gender, household size, education, farming experience, farm size, and extension contacts were positive and significantly influenced crop production. Climate variables such as temperature, rainfall, number of rainy days were negative while sunshine hours and relative humidity were positive and both significantly influenced crop production in the state. Inadequate capital, land fragmentations, and inadequate information concerning climate change were perceived as major production and climatic constraints. Climate change should be technically mitigated to avert future negative consequences. Intensive awareness on climate change and provision of climate information and/or early warning signals to the knowledge of the crop farmers were recommended.\\nThis is a preview of subscription content, log in via an institution to check access.\\nThis is a preview of subscription content, log in via an institution to check access.\\nAccess this chapter Log in via an institution Subscribe and save Springer+ Basic $34.99 /Month Get 10 units per month Download Article/Chapter or eBook 1 Unit = 1 Article or 1 Chapter Cancel anytime Subscribe now Buy Now Chapter USD 29.95 Price excludes VAT (USA) Available as PDF Read on any device Instant download Own it forever Buy Chapter eBook USD 179.99 Price excludes VAT (USA) Available as EPUB and PDF Read on any device Instant download Own it forever Buy eBook Softcover Book USD 219.99 Price excludes VAT (USA) Compact, lightweight edition Dispatched in 3 to 5 business days Free shipping worldwide -

You can register here Notify me Climate change presents weighty challenges globally, with Nigeria particularly vulnerable to its multifaceted impacts. This review explores the effects of climate change-induced droughts and floods on food security in Nigeria, where agriculture is central to economic stability and livelihoods. The analysis integrates a comprehensive metadata evaluation, identifying trends, thematic gaps, and regional disparities in existing research. It examines how extreme weather events have intensified issues related to food supply, economic resilience, and well-being, underscoring the critical need for adaptive strategies. A systematic review of 2,500 publications, following PRISMA criteria, narrowed the focus to 450 studies, with 104 highquality studies undergoing in-depth analysis. Metadata analysis revealed an increase in research interest post-2010, a lack of longitudinal studies, and an underrepresentation of semiarid northern regions in the literature. Findings indicate a growing threat to Nigeria's food security, as frequent flooding destroys infrastructure, erodes topsoil, and reduces agricultural productivity, leading to lower food output and increased costs. At the same time, droughts, particularly in the semi-arid north, drastically reduce crop yields and worsen food insecurity by depleting vital water resources. These challenges disproportionately affect smallholder farmers and pastoral communities, waning poverty and hunger. The review highlights the complexity of Nigeria's food insecurity, shaped by factors such as geography, socioeconomic status, and adaptive capacity. Despite advancements in adaptation strategies, issues like fragmented policies and inadequate infrastructure continue to hinder effective responses.However, the review identifies key opportunities to enhance food security and resilience, including greater stakeholder engagement, increased investment in climate adaptation, and the use of digital technologies. By addressing these challenges and leveraging these opportunities, Nigeria can build a more resilient and sustainable food system capable of withstanding the increasing threats posed by climate change.

This review explores the effects of climate change-induced droughts and floods on food security in Nigeria, where agriculture is central to economic stability and livelihoods. The analysis integrates a comprehensive metadata evaluation, identifying trends, thematic gaps, and regional disparities in existing research. It examines how extreme weather events have intensified issues related to food supply, economic resilience, and well-being, underscoring the critical need for adaptive strategies. A systematic review of 2,500 publications, following PRISMA criteria, narrowed the focus to 450 studies, with 104 highquality studies undergoing in-depth analysis. Metadata analysis revealed an increase in research interest post-2010, a lack of longitudinal studies, and an underrepresentation of semiarid northern regions in the literature. Findings indicate a growing threat to Nigeria's food security, as frequent flooding destroys infrastructure, erodes topsoil, and reduces agricultural productivity, leading to lower food output and increased costs. At the same time, droughts, particularly in the semi-arid north, drastically reduce crop yields and worsen food insecurity by depleting vital water resources. These challenges disproportionately affect smallholder farmers and pastoral communities, waning poverty and hunger. The review highlights the complexity of Nigeria's food insecurity, shaped by factors such as geography, socioeconomic status, and adaptive capacity. Despite advancements in adaptation strategies, issues like fragmented policies and inadequate infrastructure continue to hinder effective responses.However, the review identifies key opportunities to enhance food security and resilience, including greater stakeholder engagement, increased investment in climate adaptation, and the use of digital technologies.

This review explores the effects of climate change-induced droughts and floods on food security in Nigeria, where agriculture is central to economic stability and livelihoods. The analysis integrates a comprehensive metadata evaluation, identifying trends, thematic gaps, and regional disparities in existing research. It examines how extreme weather events have intensified issues related to food supply, economic resilience, and well-being, underscoring the critical need for adaptive strategies. A systematic review of 2,500 publications, following PRISMA criteria, narrowed the focus to 450 studies, with 104 highquality studies undergoing in-depth analysis. Metadata analysis revealed an increase in research interest post-2010, a lack of longitudinal studies, and an underrepresentation of semiarid northern regions in the literature. Findings indicate a growing threat to Nigeria's food security, as frequent flooding destroys infrastructure, erodes topsoil, and reduces agricultural productivity, leading to lower food output and increased costs. At the same time, droughts, particularly in the semi-arid north, drastically reduce crop yields and worsen food insecurity by depleting vital water resources. These challenges disproportionately affect smallholder farmers and pastoral communities, waning poverty and hunger. The review highlights the complexity of Nigeria's food insecurity, shaped by factors such as geography, socioeconomic status, and adaptive capacity. Despite advancements in adaptation strategies, issues like fragmented policies and inadequate infrastructure continue to hinder effective responses.However, the review identifies key opportunities to enhance food security and resilience, including greater stakeholder engagement, increased investment in climate adaptation, and the use of digital technologies. By addressing these challenges and leveraging these opportunities, Nigeria can build a more resilient and sustainable food system capable of withstanding the increasing threats posed by climate change.\\nKeywords: Climate change impacts, Food security, Floods and droughts, adaptation strategies, Nigeria Received: 08 Sep 2024; Accepted: 23 Dec 2024.

Prof. Miko also fingered changes in pest and disease dynamics, and impacts on livestock productivity and health as other effects of climate change on agricultural activities in Nigeria. Miko disclosed this when he gave a keynote lecture at this year’s National Agricultural Extension Review and Planning Meeting held at the National Agricultural Extension and Research Liaison Services (NAERLS), Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria. The keynote speaker, who was Country Director, SG (Sasakawa Global) 2000, Nigeria, teaches at the Faculty of Agriculture, Bayero University, Zaria. Prof. Miko, who was also Dean of Agriculture, Bayero University, Kano, explained that warmer temperatures and altered rainfall patterns in Nigeria affect crop growth, leading to reduced yields and lower quality produce. He said floods, droughts, and heat waves are becoming more frequent, damaging crops and disrupting agricultural activities and that changes in temperature and rainfall patterns are altering the timing of growing seasons, making it challenging for farmers to adapt. The don also explained that warmer temperatures and changing precipitation patterns are favouring the spread of diseases while increased carbondioxide levels are altering the distribution and prevalence of disease vectors like ticks and mosquitoes. Prof. Miko further explained that increased temperatures cause heat stress in livestock, leading to reduced productivity, fertility issues, and increased mortality rates and that changes in precipitation patterns affect water availability, impacting livestock hydration and feed quality. Miko, however, recommended a number of measures that can address the challenges, saying that the national climate change policy should be functionalised. He also recommended that institutional capacity building for climate change should be conducted and that climate information services must be installed and equipped with early warning systems. Prof. Miko further suggested for the promotion of incentives for climate-resilient agriculture adoption and development of climate-resilient agriculture strategies and plans. ………………….Public Affairs Directorate,Office of the Vice-Chancellor,Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria(NAM)Tuesday, 3rd December, 2024 Post navigation ← Previous PostNext Post → Related News Dec 25 2024 After completion of 20-hectare pasture seed plot, NAPRI hands over project to Kano Govt Dec 23 2024 Christmas and New Year Celebrations Dec 19 2024 ABU’s Life Sciences Faculty cornerstone of academic excellence, says VC SearchSearchRecent PostsAfter completion of 20-hectare pasture seed plot, NAPRI hands over project to Kano Govt Christmas and New Year Celebrations ABU’s Life Sciences Faculty cornerstone of academic excellence, says VC Life Sciences Faculty honours 27 staff members for ‘exceptional dedication’ to work ANAN recognises ABU VC as ‘Icon of Excellent Leadership and Scholarship’ Recent CommentsNo comments to show.Archives December 2024 November 2024 October 2024 September 2024 August 2024 July 2024 June 2024 May 2024 April 2024 March 2024 February 2024 January 2024 December 2023 November 2023 October 2023 September 2023 August 2023 July 2023 June 2023 January 2023 December 2022 November 2022 October 2022 February 2022 March 2021 July 2020 April 2020 September 2019 May 2019 April 2019 Categories Administration animal use Education Events Featured Staff Inaugural Lecture News News Magazines Press Statement Resources Special Bulletins Sport Symposiums Search for: Recent Posts After completion of 20-hectare pasture seed plot, NAPRI hands over project to Kano Govt Christmas and New Year Celebrations ABU’s Life Sciences Faculty cornerstone of academic excellence, says VC Life Sciences Faculty honours 27 staff members for ‘exceptional dedication’ to work ANAN recognises ABU VC as ‘Icon of Excellent Leadership and Scholarship’ Recent CommentsArchives December 2024 November 2024 October 2024 September 2024 August 2024 July 2024 June 2024 May 2024 April 2024 March 2024 February 2024 January 2024 December 2023 November 2023 October 2023 September 2023 August 2023 July 2023 June 2023 January 2023 December 2022 November 2022 October 2022 February 2022 March 2021 July 2020 April 2020 September 2019 May 2019 April 2019 Categories Administration animal use Education Events Featured Staff Inaugural Lecture News News Magazines Press Statement Resources Special Bulletins Sport Symposiums About usMenu Toggle Governing Council Central AdministrationMenu Toggle Principal Officers Security Division History AcademicsMenu Toggle Faculties Schools and Colleges Institutes Centres ResearchProgrammesPolicyLife in ABUMenu Toggle Campus Community TETFundAdmission GuidelinesAffiliated InstitutionsAlumniDirectoratesEthics FormLibraryMemoranda of UnderstandingInformation for StaffInformation for StudentsUnits ABU MuseumAdmission GuidelinesAffiliated InstitutionsAlumni ConnectDirectoratesEthics FormGreen CampusInformation for StaffInformation for StudentsLibrariesMOUUnits Senate Building, Ahmadu Bello University, Samaru Campus, Zaria, Kaduna State, Nigeria Facilities and ServicesUniversity Health Services Counselling & Human Dev Centre Electricity Bulk Metering Unit Quick LinksPrivacy Policies Admissions Animal Use Contact Us Human Subject Login Other LinksSchool of Basic and Remedial Studies School of Post Graduate Studies University Library Search Copyright © 2024 Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria.

Miko disclosed this when he gave a keynote lecture at this year’s National Agricultural Extension Review and Planning Meeting held at the National Agricultural Extension and Research Liaison Services (NAERLS), Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria. The keynote speaker, who was Country Director, SG (Sasakawa Global) 2000, Nigeria, teaches at the Faculty of Agriculture, Bayero University, Zaria. Prof. Miko, who was also Dean of Agriculture, Bayero University, Kano, explained that warmer temperatures and altered rainfall patterns in Nigeria affect crop growth, leading to reduced yields and lower quality produce. He said floods, droughts, and heat waves are becoming more frequent, damaging crops and disrupting agricultural activities and that changes in temperature and rainfall patterns are altering the timing of growing seasons, making it challenging for farmers to adapt. The don also explained that warmer temperatures and changing precipitation patterns are favouring the spread of diseases while increased carbondioxide levels are altering the distribution and prevalence of disease vectors like ticks and mosquitoes. Prof. Miko further explained that increased temperatures cause heat stress in livestock, leading to reduced productivity, fertility issues, and increased mortality rates and that changes in precipitation patterns affect water availability, impacting livestock hydration and feed quality. Miko, however, recommended a number of measures that can address the challenges, saying that the national climate change policy should be functionalised. He also recommended that institutional capacity building for climate change should be conducted and that climate information services must be installed and equipped with early warning systems. Prof. Miko further suggested for the promotion of incentives for climate-resilient agriculture adoption and development of climate-resilient agriculture strategies and plans. ………………….Public Affairs

Traditional agriculture, deeply rooted in the region's history and culture, is particularly vulnerable to these changes. This study investigates the adaptation strategies of traditional agricultural farmers to climate change using southeast Nigeria as a microcosm of the broader challenges facing sub-Saharan Africa. Methods: Multistage sampling procedure was used to select 75 farmer group leaders in the study region. Cross-sectional data were collected through semi-structured interview schedules and focus group discussions. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and principal component analysis using Varimax rotated matrix. Results: Findings showed that farmers rely on face-to-face discussions with neighbors (76.0%), fellow farmers (66.7%), and radio (54.7%) as their primary sources of information on climate change. Results showed that traditional adaptation practices such as use of organic manure (x¯ = 3.89), traditional organic composting (x¯ = 3.80), afforestation (x¯ = 3.71), agroforestry (x¯ = 3.61) were the topmost traditional agricultural practices use to cushion the effect of climate change. Conserving the overall soil health, soil moisture retention, reducing CO2 emissions and maintaining crop productivity were the major reasons for using the traditional approaches. Climate-induced drought and high cost of accessing weather information (x¯ = 1.93), and inadequate funding (x¯ = 1.92), among others were the key constraints to adaptation. Discussion: Results showed that farmers prioritize agronomic manipulation and integrated research approaches as key strategies to adapting traditional agriculture to climate anomalies. Although farmers used their indigenous practices, continuous learning and improvement through capacity-building workshops and progress monitoring are essential for effective climate change adaptation. Policymakers should invest in promoting indigenous knowledge, provide access to credit for climate-resilient infrastructure, promote climate-smart agricultural practices and foster collaborative research as the cornerstone for sustainable rural development. 1 Introduction Sub-Saharan Africa, a vast and diverse region characterized by its rich cultural heritage and ecological variety, has long been recognized as a crucial battleground in the fight against climate change and its devastating consequences (Thompson et al., 2010). The region is particularly vulnerable to climate change, with multiple biophysical, political, and socioeconomic stresses interacting to affect rural communities, where agriculture is a major lifeline. Studies consistently predict decreased crop productivity, land degradation, high market prices, and negative impacts on livelihoods, exacerbating food insecurity in the region (Emediegwu et al., 2022; Oyelami et al., 2023). Climate change is intensifying food insecurity across sub-Saharan Africa, and leading to changes in yield and area growth, higher food prices, reduced calorie availability, and growing childhood malnutrition (Ringler et al., 2010). Salgado Baptista et al. (2022) projected the crop yield, especially in key staples, in the region to decline by 5–17% by 2050 due to rising temperatures and rainfall volatility. Successive weather shocks, such as droughts and floods, significantly raise food insecurity, particularly in countries where agricultural productivity is already below the global average (Salgado Baptista et al., 2022). With a predominantly agrarian economy dominated by stallholder farmers and a heavy reliance on traditional agricultural practices rooted in centuries of local knowledge and practices, the nations of sub-Saharan Africa are acutely vulnerable to the adverse impacts of a changing climate. Nigeria, as the most populous country in Africa, serves as a microcosm of the broader challenges and opportunities facing sub-Saharan Africa. It plays a pivotal role in the region's agricultural landscape and is emblematic of the broader climate adaptation issues faced by many nations in sub-Saharan Africa. Nigeria is estimated to contribute 14% of Africa's agriculture GDP, making it one of the top three African countries with the highest GDP contribution from agriculture (Oyaniran and Omomia, 2018). Between January and March 2021, agriculture contributed to 22.35% of Nigeria's GDP, with over 140 million Nigerians engaged in the sector mainly at a subsistence level. On formal level, more than 36% (above 28.9 million) of Nigeria's labor force was employed in agriculture, with over 80% of the agricultural workforce being smallholder farmers (FAO, 2019; Mayong et al., 2021; International Trade Administration, 2023). Nigeria possesses an abundance of arable land and a favorable climate to produce various crops, including maize, cassava, guinea corn, yam, beans, millet, and rice (FAO, 2019). However, despite its significant contribution to the economy, Nigeria's agricultural sector faces formidable challenges such as climate change and climate-induced socio-economic stressors. These challenges have stifled agricultural productivity, affecting the sector's contribution to the country's GDP and leading to increased food imports due to population growth (FAO, 2019). The impacts of climate change in Nigeria are characterized by increasing climate variability, leading to more intense and untimely rainfall, land degradation, flash floods, landslides, and gully erosion (Ghosh, 2019; World Bank, 2022). By 2009, an estimated 6,000 gullies were destroying infrastructure, farmland, and real estate across rural and urban Nigeria, causing fear and despair among the population (World Bank, 2022). The climate change-induced losses and unsustainable use of resources have elevated themselves to a real development challenge in Nigeria, particularly along the coastal states in the south and the northern frontline states, thwarting the age-old rhythms of traditional agriculture which are rooted in centuries of local knowledge and practices. The negative impacts of climate change on Nigeria's agriculture have been observed predominantly in the northern, northeastern, southwestern and southeast regions, which experience extreme weather conditions (Tajudeen et al., 2022; World Bank, 2022). The loss of life and property due to sudden, unpredictable, and uncontrollable floods is a nightmare for many Nigerians, destroying crops, farms, lands, and houses. The agricultural sector, which is the country's economic mainstay, is also grappling with lower crop yields, food insecurity, deepening poverty, forced displacement, labor inefficiency due to high temperatures and conflicts due to drought, flooding, sea level rise, erosion, and rapid decline in earth's limiting resources (Brouziyne et al., 2018; Obaji et al., 2022; United Nations Development Programme, 2023). In 2022 alone, climate-induced pests and diseases insurgence caused crop losses of up to 80% in some areas, impacting 1.5–200,000 hectares of land, and more than 20% of crops experienced post-harvest losses in several states (Adegwu, 2022). Major crops affected included maize, rice, sorghum, millet, soybean, groundnut, cowpea, root and tubers, fruits, vegetables, and tree crops in 33 states (Adegwu, 2022; Rizzo et al., 2023). The country's tropical climate is characterized by high temperatures, humidity, and rainfall, with larger amounts of rainfall experienced in the south and southeast regions of the country. Wind patterns are influenced by Nigeria's location and topography, largely due to the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) which brings moist winds from the Atlantic Ocean during the wet season and dry winds from the Sahara Desert during the dry season (Dia et al., 2023), which influences the annual temperature. The Nigeria temperature records indicate an average increase of 1.4–1.9°C, with predictions of further increases of 2–5°C by the end of the century if no decisive action is taken (Brouziyne et al., 2018). Nigeria is already experiencing the adverse effects of climate change, as with natural disasters are occurring more frequently and with greater intensity. These multi-dimensional adverse effects have not only hampered the ability of the agricultural sector to meet the country's food demands but have also disrupted the traditional roles of agriculture in Nigeria's economy, leading to a shift from being a net food exporter to an importer (Onyeneke et al., 2021). The cumulative agricultural imports of the country stood at N3.35 trillion between 2016 and 2019, which was four times higher than the agricultural export of N803 billion within the same period (FAO, 2019). Therefore, it is crucial to explore and implement interdisciplinary adaptation strategies that can enhance the sustainability and resilience of agri-food systems to climate anomalies. Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) has emerged as a competent response to the challenges posed by climate change on agriculture in rural areas. It entails the integration of traditional agricultural practices with modern techniques. Traditional agriculture, rooted in indigenous knowledge, cultural beliefs, and sustainable practices, offers valuable insights into adapting agricultural systems to a changing climate (Tsado, 2019). The approach of CSA is recognized for its potential to enhance farm productivity and incomes, adaptation, and resilience to climate change in rural African context (Abegunde and Obi, 2022). CSA offers a comprehensive strategy for addressing the interconnected challenges faced by smallholder farmers in African countries, focusing on three core goals: increasing agricultural productivity, adapting and building resilience to climate change, and developing opportunities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture (Obaji et al., 2022). Additionally, the FAO emphasizes that CSA is an approach that helps guide actions to transform agri-food systems toward green and climate-resilient practices, addressing challenges related to climate change and agriculture (FAO, 2023). However, CSA is not a one-size-fits-all approach and requires tailoring to specific climate risks faced by different farming communities, regions, and ecosystems. While CSA offers a solution to many of the secondary and tertiary problems caused by climate shocks, it is still not a familiar solution to climate adaptation and mitigation in last-mile communities. The effective utilization of CSA at grassroots is not just about understanding “how its works” but in appreciating the intricate web of cultural, economic, ecological, and technological factors that influence this adaptation tactics. Rural communities in sub-Saharan Africa are adapting their traditional agriculture to climate change through a variety of strategies and practices. Indigenous peoples and local communities are leveraging traditional knowledge and improved crop varieties to cope with extreme weather and environmental changes caused by climate change (Swiderska, 2011). Traditional agricultural practices, which have been developed over centuries, are proving to be valuable in building resilience and adapting to the impacts of climate change (Singh and Singh, 2017). Adjustments in planting dates, crop varieties, drainage systems, using advanced technologies and land management regimes to maintain yields and soil fertility (Arbuckle et al., 2015), are crucial on-the-ground strategies used by local farmers to counter the adverse effects of climatic changes. Traditional practices, such as agroforestry, intercropping, crop rotation, cover cropping, traditional organic composting, and integrated crop-animal farming, have demonstrated the potential to improve crop productivity and mitigate climate change impacts (Tripathi et al., 2019; Mashi et al., 2022). These practices, honed over thousands of years by indigenous farmers and local communities, provide valuable adaptation strategies in the face of climate uncertainties. Traditional agricultural practices have the potential to adapt and mitigate climate change through its unique agroecological features. They increase agrobiodiversity and resilience of agroecosystems, are low-cost, energy-efficient, and based on locally available resources (Singh and Singh, 2017). It is characterized by high productivity, biodiversity conservation, low energy inputs, and climate change mitigation (Singh and Singh, 2017). Therefore, integrating traditional knowledge into climate change policies is seen as a cost-effective, climate-smart approach and sustainable adaptation strategy to climate variability. While there is a growing recognition of the role of traditional knowledge in adapting agriculture to climate change, the role of indigenous knowledge and adaptive practices remains largely undervalued by decision-makers. Negotiating parties in international climate talks tend to focus on intensifying production through modern agriculture, overlooking the potential of traditional knowledge in adaptation (Swiderska, 2011). The unsustainable transition from traditional agriculture to modern methods in rural communities has led to the loss of crop genetic resources and environmental sustainability challenges, exacerbating the effects of climate change. Therefore, there is an urgent need to rediscover and re-implement traditional agricultural practices while integrating them with modern approaches to enhance the socio-ecological integrity of agroecosystems (Shittu et al., 2021). Ricart et al. (2023) analyzed a portfolio of 435 articles collected from WoS and Scopus databases between 2010 and 2020, finding that farmers are in a favorable position to offer first-hand observations and provide a deeper understanding of climate change manifestation, relevance, effects, and narratives. Therefore, farmers' knowledge provides a framework for appraising and incorporating new ideas, experiences, and information into existing systems (Haradhan, 2017). This study explored the adaptation strategies employed by farmers to mitigate the impacts of climate change on their indigenous agricultural system using southeast Nigeria as a model region for all riparian regions in sub-Saharan Africa. The specific objective of the study entails identifying the key climate change information sources by farmers; elicit the effective traditional adaptation practices farmers use to cushion the effect of climate change; examine the possible reasons for using traditional approaches to climate change adaptation, identify the constraints to adaptation, and the effective strategies to adapt and mitigate the effect of climate change. The grand objective of the study is to provide grassroots insights and recommendations for fostering sustainability and climate-resilient agri-food systems in sub-Saharan Africa. 2 Methodology The study was carried out in Southeast Nigeria, specifically within the geographical coordinates of latitudes 04° 17′N and 07° 06′N and longitudes 05° 23′E and 09° 28′E, as described in Macmillian's 2009 report. This region covers an area spanning 29,908 square kilometers and is inhabited by ~16,381,729 people, according to the Nigeria. National Bureau of Statistics (2007). It encompasses the territories of Abia state, Anambra state, Ebonyi state, Enugu state, and Imo state (see Figure 1). The climate of the Southeast can be broadly characterized as tropical, featuring distinct wet and dry seasons. It falls within the tropical belt, with early rainfall typically occurring in January/February and the full onset of the rainy season in March, concluding in November each year. The dry season typically lasts for 4–5 months, with the highest rainfall occurring from July to October, with a slight respite in August. On average, the region experiences an annual rainfall of ~1,952 mm, and the mean daily and annual temperatures are around 28 and 27°C, respectively (Igbokwe et al., 2008). Southeast Nigeria is primarily an agricultural area, with predominantly sandy and often loose and porous soil types. The most commonly cultivated crops in this region include cassava, rice, yam, cocoyam, maize, plantain/banana, cashew, oil palm, and coconut. Additionally, the major livestock raised in the area consist of goats, sheep, and poultry. In the southeastern region, the effects of climate change are readily noticeable, manifested in increased instances of flooding, landslides, and erosion, which have resulted in the loss of lives, homes, farmlands, properties, and roads, among other adverse consequences (Agwu and Okhimamhe, 2009). Figure 1 Figure 1. Map of southeast Nigeria. Source: Macmillian Atlas Series 2009. The population for the study comprised all farmers and relevant stakeholders operating in difficult-to-reach communities in the study region. Respondents were selected using a multi-stage sampling procedure. In the first stage, the five states that make up the Southeast Nigeria were selected purposefully to have good spread and depth of data and local perspectives. In the second stage, three senatorial zones were randomly selected in each state, given a total of 15 senatorial zones. In the third stage, five representative lead-farmers each were randomly selected from each of the 15 senatorial zones, given a total of 75 farmers used for the study. Data were collected using a semi-structure interview schedule and focus group discussion based on the specific objectives. The reliability of the instrument was tested using the Cronbach Alpha coefficient for internal consistency. The instrument was validated by experts in the Department of Agricultural Extension, University of Nigeria, Nsukka. Personal data, such as age (in years), gender (male or female), marital status (single, married, divorced/separated, and widowed), education (number of years spent in school), farming experience (years), household size (number of persons currently in the household), household monthly income (naira), estimated annual earnings (naira), access to extension service (number of times in the past 1 year), membership to the social organization(s), and access to credit facilities, were collected. Sources of information on climate change were collected by asking respondents to tick “Yes” or “No” from a list of information sources. Data on the effective traditional adaptation practices used to cushion the effects of climate change were collected by providing a list of perceived traditional practices. Respondents were required to rate the effective adaptive practices on a four-point Likert-type scale of very effective (4), effective (3), a little effective (2) and not effective (1). A mean score (2.5) was obtained. Variables with a mean score ≥2.5 were regarded as effective practices. Information on possible reasons for using traditional approaches for climate change adaptation were obtained by providing a list of variables for the respondents. Respondents were asked to rank the importance of traditional practices to their climate adaptation from a list of practices on a 3-point Likert scale of very important (3), important (2) and not important (1). A mean score (2) was obtained and all the variables with mean score ≥2 were regarded as important to adaptive capacity. Data on constraints to adaptation and mitigation were collected by asking the respondents to rank their constraints on a 3-point Likert scale of major constraint (2), minor constraint (1), not a constraint (0)—with a mean score of one. Data on the effectiveness of the strategies to mitigate the effect of climate change was measured by asking respondents to choose from a list of variables provided. Their responses were captured on a four-point Likert-type scale of very effective (4), effective (3), little effective (2), and not effective (1). A mean score (2.5) was obtained. Responses with a mean score ≥2.5 were regarded as effective. Excerpts from semi structure interviews and focus group discussions were reported in the result section of the article. Data obtained were analyzed with descriptive statistics (percentages, mean, and standard deviation) and principal component analysis using Varimax rotated factors analysis—through the IBM SPSS Statistics version 21 software. 3 Results 3.1 Socioeconomic characteristics of the farmers According to Table 1, results reveal that 52.0% of the respondents were female, while 48.0% were male. Regarding age distribution, most respondents (28.0%) fell within the 31–40 age range. Approximately 24.0% were aged between 41 and 50, 20.0% were 60 and above, and 18.7% were 30 and below. Only 9.3% were between 51 and 60 years old. The mean age of the farmers was 46.11, suggesting the active participation of middle-aged individuals in traditional agriculture. Regarding household size, a significant proportion (72.0%) of respondents had a household size of 5–8 persons, while 12.0% had 1–4 persons, and 16.0% had 8 or more persons. The results also indicate that the mean monthly household income was ₦20,093.33. Table 1 Table 1. Socioeconomic characteristics of the respondents (n = 75). 3.2 Sources of information by farmers on climate change adaptation The results in Table 2 indicate that most (76.0%) respondents obtain information on climate change, adaptation, and mitigation through face-to-face discussions with neighbors. This implies that community-based community approaches could be highly effective in disseminating information about climate change. Leveraging indigenous communication channels such as implementing community meetings or local discussion groups could be a strategic way to spread awareness and knowledge on climate adaptation and mitigation measures. Additionally, 66.7% of the respondents acquired information from fellow farmers. This implies that farmers probably trust and value the experiences and knowledge of their peers. Programs that engage local farmers as educators or facilitators could leverage this trust and peer influence for effective communication on climate resilience building. The reliance on radio by more than half 54.7% of respondents highlights its importance as a traditional but still relevant medium, especially in areas where digital connectivity might be limited. Radio programs focused on climate change, featuring expert advice, success stories from other farmers, and practical tips for adaptation and mitigation, could be a very effective outreach tool. Other information sources include videos (29.3%), newsletters on climate change (22.7%), internet (21.3%), television (20.0%), and among others. The variety of climate change information sources used by farmers underscores the need for a multi-channel communication strategy—since informal channels (neighbors and fellow farmers) could brood risk of misinformation or incomplete information being circulated. Table 2 Table 2. Source of information of farmers on climate changes (n = 75). 3.3 Effective traditional adaptation practices farmers use to cushion the effect of climate change In Table 3 show the traditional adaptation practices farmers use to cushion the effect of climate change. The traditional adaptation practices used include use of organic manure (x¯ = 3.89), traditional organic composting (x¯ = 3.80), afforestation (x¯ = 3.71), agroforestry (x¯ = 3.61), crop rotation (x¯ = 3.40), and mulching (x¯ = 3.37). These practices not only help in adapting to climate change but also contribute to mitigating its effects by enhancing carbon sequestration and biodiversity. For instance, the use of organic manure by the study participants is due to their accessibility, cost-effectiveness, or perceived effectiveness in improving soil health and resilience against climate variability. Excerpts from the focus group discussion indicate that farmers unanimously agree that [“…they use organic manure due to their accessibility, cost-effectiveness, or perceived effectiveness in improving soil health and resilience against climate variability…”]. Hence, these practices indicate a level of knowledge and adaptation to local climatic conditions. Table 3 Table 3. Traditional adaptation practices farmers use to cushion the effect of climate change (n = 75). Other traditional adaptation practices include intercropping (x¯ = 3.36), planting of cover crops and irrigation (x¯ = 3.29), integrated crop-animal farming (x¯ = 3.21), bush fallow practices (x¯ = 3.13), and among others. The use of intercropping and integrated crop-animal farming implies that indigenous people and communities prioritizes diversification as a key risk management strategy against the backdrop of climate change. Additionally, the use of irrigation, bush fallowing and covering crops indicates an awareness of and response to the need for optimal resource utilization, maintenance of soil health and sustainability, which is crucial for long-term agricultural productivity in the face of climate change. 3.4 Possible reasons for using traditional approaches to climate change adaptation Table 4 presents the key reasons for using traditional approaches to climate change adaptation. The reasons identified include increased soil fertility (x¯ = 2.95), aeration of soil (x¯ = 2.85), reduction of soil erosion (x¯ = 2.73), increase in soil moisture (x¯ = 2.03), enhancement of soil structure and aggregation (x¯ = 2.79), promotion of mineralization of nitrogen-containing compounds in the soil through the use of leguminous crops (x¯ = 2.68), reduction of nutrient loss from the soil (x¯ = 2.73), reduction of chemical pollution in the soil (x¯ = 2.33), and enhancement of agro-biodiversity through intercropping of legumes (x¯ = 2.56). This implies that farmers are aware of the importance of soil health in sustainable farming and climate change adaptation. This reflects a desire to maintain sustainable, eco-friendly farming practices that not only benefit the current crop but also contribute to the long-term health of the farm ecosystem. The reliance on traditional methods to deliver these benefits indicates a strong base of traditional agricultural knowledge and practices well-suited to local environmental conditions that have been passed down through generations. While these traditional practices are beneficial, there is potential for enhancing their effectiveness through the integration of scientific research and modern agricultural techniques. Table 4 Table 4. Possible reasons for using traditional approaches to climate change adaptation. 3.5 Constraints to adapting traditional agriculture to climate change Table 5 presents the constraints identified by the respondents to the use of traditional adaptation strategies. The major constraints to adaptation include climate variation leading to drought and high cost of accessing weather information (x¯ = 1.93), and inadequate funding (x¯ = 1.92). Access to micro-climate cues and finances are crucial in building local adaptation strategies. High cost of accessing reliable weather information frustrates traditional adaptive measures, making it difficult for farmers to plan and make informed climate-smart decisions effectively. It is therefore imperative to provide a more accessible, affordable, and accurate weather forecasting services tailored for farmers alongside financial assistance programs, subsidies, or microfinance solutions targeted at smallholder farmers. Participants also indicated that lack of technical knowledge and know-how (x¯ = 1.89) pose a major challenge to adapt. Mrs. Ngozika, a rural farmer from the study participant stated thus [“…I do not know the practical steps I could take to improve my farm activities in this era of climate change…”]. This implies a gap in the knowledge and skills necessary to implement effective adaptation strategies, which could probably be due to inadequate extension services or training programs. Inadequate infrastructure (x¯ = 1.87), such as roads and storage facilities, limits the ability of farmers to adapt to and mitigate the impacts of climate change. There is a need for governmental and non-governmental bodies to invest in rural infrastructure to support agricultural activities. Also, inadequate access to climate change information (x¯ = 1.85) present a formidable obstacle to rural adaptive capacities. This aligns with the high cost of accessing weather information and highlights a broader issue of information accessibility. Vulnerability to pests and diseases (x¯ = 1.83) resulting from climate change bedevils farmers adaptation efforts. Therefore, research into and promotion of climate-resilient crop varieties and integrated pest management practices are crucial for traditional agricultural systems. Other constraints faced by farmers include inadequate credit facilities (x¯ = 1.79), poor agricultural program and service delivery (x¯ = 1.69), high economic losses from farming (x¯ = 1.65), among others. Table 5 Table 5. Constraints to adaptation. Table 6 presents the results of the factor analysis of the constraints to adaptation. The variables with a loading of 0.4 score and above were included in naming the factors. Variables that loaded in more than one factor or had loadings below 0.4 were not used. Two key factors were identified and named: a technical problem (Factor 1) and a climate information problem (Factor 2). Under the technical problem (Factor 1), the major constraints identified by farmers include poor agricultural program and service delivery (loading = 0.768), high cost of farm operations (loading = 0.663), lack of skilled laboratory facilities for farm practices (loading = 0.650), inconsistent government policies (loading = 0.580), lack of extension services for providing information to farmers (loading = 0.539), high economic losses from farming (loading = 0.500), and vulnerability to pests and diseases (loading = 0.487). In Factor 2, the climate informational problem includes the high cost of accessing weather information (loading = 0.692) and drought climate variation (loading = 0.515). The factor analysis provides a clear framework for understanding the complex array of challenges in agricultural adaptation, emphasizing the need for comprehensive, well-coordinated responses that address both immediate technical issues and longer-term climate information accessibility challenges. Table 6 Table 6. Varimax rotated factors on constraints to adaptation. 3.6 Possible strategies to adapt and mitigate the effect of climate change Table 7 presents the respondents' responses regarding adopting respective mitigation measures. The major strategies adopted by farmers include the use of organic manure (x¯ = 3.87), use of resistant crops (score x¯ = 3.85), use of drought-resistant crops (x¯ = 3.68), and use of flood-tolerant crops (x¯ = 3.73). Farmers can adopt resistant crop varieties that are better suited to withstand the impacts of climate change, such as drought, extreme temperatures, and pests. Also, afforestation (planting trees; x¯ = 3.67), and use of use of cover crops (x¯ = 3.47) are important strategies to adapt and mitigate the effect of climate change. Excerpts from the focus group discussion indicate that farmers unanimously agree that [“…Planting palm, orange, and gmelina help remove climate pollutants from the atmosphere, contribute to climate change mitigation and provide additional benefits such as soil conservation and biodiversity enhancement…”]. Furthermore, the participant indicated access to reliable weather forecasting services (x¯ = 3.86) could help farmers make informed decisions and adapt their farming practices to changing climate conditions, thereby mitigating risks associated with irregular rainfall patterns. Famers also indicated that climate-smart agriculture practices (x¯ = 3.93) are important adaptation strategies. Implementing climate-smart agricultural practices, such as conservation tillage, diversified crop rotations, and rotational grazing, could effectively mitigate climate change impacts by sequestering carbon and enhancing soil health. Table 7 Table 7. Possible strategies to adopt and mitigate the effect of climate change (n = 75). Other important strategies identified by the respondents include incorporation of residues into the soil (x¯ = 3.23), proper conservation of seeds (x¯ = 3.75), provision of adequate mulching materials (x¯ = 3.40), among others. These strategies align with the principles of climate-resilient agriculture, which aims to enhance the adaptive capacity of agricultural systems and reduce their vulnerability to climate change while contributing to climate change mitigation. Table 8 shows the Varimax rotated factors of possible strategies to adopt and mitigate the effect of climate change. Variables that had loadings of 0.4 and above being included in naming the factors. Variables that loaded in more than one factor or had loadings below 0.4 were not used. Two factors were identified and named: agronomic methods (Factor 1) and research methods (Factor 2). Under the agronomic methods (Factor 1), the major strategies identified by farmers include changing the timing of farm operations (loading = 0.777), availability of extension service delivery (loading = 0.774), incorporation of residues into the soil (loading = 0.738), provision of adequate mulching materials (loading = 0.674), provision of infrastructure (loading = 0.550), use of resistant crops (loading = 0.535), and afforestation (loading = 0.414). In Factor 2, the research methods, the strategies identified are proper conservation of seeds (loading = 0.580), provision of adequate farm input supplies (loading = 0.437), and increased investment in agricultural research and development (loading = 0.424). Table 8 Table 8. Varimax rotated factors of possible strategies to adopt and mitigate the effect of climate change. 4 Discussion 4.1 Demographic characteristics of the farmers The United Nations reports that households in three Sub-Saharan African countries have an average of over 6 members each. Senegal stands out with one of the largest household sizes in Africa, averaging 10.8 members (United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division, 2019). These significant household sizes in Sub-Saharan Africa contribute to a valuable pool of labor for agricultural activities. The substantial household sizes in sub-Saharan Africa serve as a valuable labor reservoir for agricultural activities. Mr. Ode, a rural farmer said […I cannot afford machineries hence I use local labor, often involving family and friends…]. Compared to other regions such as North America and Europe, sub-Saharan Africa has larger average household size of 6.9 (Galal, 2023; Pew Research Center, 2023). This aligns with the result of this study of a mean household size of 6.43 people, indicating the families are relatively large and can contribute as a source of labor for farming activities. Thereby giving room for farming household to spend their extra income on other adaptive expenses. The empirical evidence from Swaziland underscored that sub-Saharan African countries could bear the brunt of climate change in terms of increased incidence of poverty and economic decline, with potential impacts on household welfare (Sam et al., 2021). The decrease in agricultural production due to the effects of climate change is a key contributing factor to farmers' reduced income. Findings showed that farmers have relatively low-income, indicating their reliance on income generated from the sales of their agricultural produce. This aligns firmly with related studies from sub-Saharan Africa (Ayanlade et al., 2018; Steinert et al., 2018; Ogada et al., 2020; Nwonu et al., 2022), which indicated that farmers within the region rely on personal savings. Farming experience is crucial to building climate resilience in traditional farming systems. Findings show that farmers have an average farming experience of 21.88 years, this implies that farmers in sub-Saharan Africa possess considerable experience addressing climate change issues in their farming practices, including adaptation and mitigation strategies (Sani and Chalchisa, 2016). However, support from governments and other organizations is crucial to enhance farmers' adaptation capacity and improve their access to resources and information. 4.2 Sources of information by farmers on climate change adaptation Smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa heavily rely on the environment for their livelihoods, making climate change adaptation crucial for their resilience. To achieve this, timely information on climate change adaptation strategies is vital. Although, there is limited information on the trend in climate information sources in sub-Saharan Africa. However, a study on smallholder farmers' climate resilience in Malawi and Ghana suggests that the relevance of information sources on climate change resilience is place-specific, and some sources may impede resilience (Amoak et al., 2023). Findings from the present study showed that across various survey regions, the main avenues through which individuals access information about climate change prominently include radio broadcasts, interactions with fellow farmers, and in-person discussions with neighbors. This widespread pattern of information dissemination aligns with the findings of multiple studies conducted not only in Anambra, as highlighted by Nwabugwu et al. (2019) and Uzochukwu et al. (2021), but also in diverse sub-Saharan African contexts. One of the noteworthy aspects of this information-sharing framework is the pivotal role of radio as a powerful and accessible medium for effectively communicating climate-related knowledge to diverse target groups across the region. According to and Antwi-Agyei et al. (2021) radio has proven to be a versatile tool in disseminating climate change information to both rural and urban communities, bridging information gaps, and promoting awareness and understanding of climate-related challenges. Additionally, community radio stations have been recognized for their ability to reach huge audiences and disseminate location-specific weather reporting, making them an effective tool for sharing climate information (Harvey et al., 2019; Global Center on Adaptation, 2023). This underscores the significance of radio as a primary and trusted source of climate-related information in sub-Saharan Africa. In addition to radio, the significance of peer interactions, particularly with fellow farmers and neighboring community members, emerges as a vital information source in the present study. A study on farmers' social networks and regional spillover effects in agricultural climate change mitigation emphasizes the positive influence of peer interactions on farmers' uptake of climate change adaptation measures (Kreft et al., 2023). Furthermore, a systematic review of smallholder farmers' climate change adaptation in sub-Saharan African indicated that knowledge integration and sharing within farming communities is important for adaptation to climate change (Jellason et al., 2022). This interpersonal exchange of knowledge within farming communities fosters the sharing of practical experiences, locally relevant adaptation strategies, and mitigation measures. Farmers can learn from one another's successes and challenges, making peer interactions a crucial component of climate change education and resilience-building efforts. It is important to acknowledge that while these channels are prevalent, there are variations in their prominence and effectiveness across sub-Saharan Africa's diverse regions and cultural contexts. 4.3 Effective traditional adaptation practices farmers use to cushion the effect of climate change Traditional adaptation practices are crucial for enhancing the climate change resilience of smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa. Findings show that all the tested traditional practices have high adoption rates as farmers utilize them to mitigate and adapt to climate change to minimize its effects. This aligns with the findings of the Crace (2019), which revealed that rural farmers have developed various strategies to reduce the impact of climate change, and these strategies have been tested and proven effective, reflecting farmers' perceptions and serving as effective mitigation and adaptation strategies. The increased application of organic manure by farmers serves multiple purposes, including enhancing soil fertility sustainably and increasing soil moisture content. Farmers noted that with rising temperatures and increased evapotranspiration caused by climate change, preserving moisture for crop use is crucial, making organic manure, planting of cover crops, bush fallow and mulching preferred options. They also emphasized that organic manure is cost-effective and readily available compared to inorganic fertilizers. This aligns with the findings of Quarshie et al. (2023) that traditional agricultural practitioners in sub-Saharan Africa implement on-farm adaptation options such as water management, and soil conservation techniques to combat climate change. Results showed that farmers deployed crop rotation, mixed cropping, intercropping, integrated crop-animal irrigation practices and shifting cultivation as key traditional soil and water management practices to adapt food crop production to climate change (Olumba et al., 2020; Benhin, 2021). This aligns with the findings of Naazie et al. (2023) who found that rural farmers in Ghana use crop diversification, intercropping, mixed farming and the adoption of improved crop varieties to adapt their agricultural production to climate change. Afforestation and agroforestry are important practices for promoting sustainable land use and mitigating the effects of climate change in sub-Saharan Africa. Results from the present study showed that farmers used afforestation and agroforestry techniques as an effective adaptation strategy as opposed mitigation strategy. These offers one of the most promising technological options for reversing soil degradation, restoring tree cover, and improving agricultural productivity in Africa. Famers reported the key agroforestry practices that helped them to adapt their agricultural system to climate change to include grazing or farming under savanna trees, growing coffee or cocoa under shade trees, planting fruit trees, sowing tree seeds on fallow land to speed up the restoration of fertility, planting “living” fences, windbreaks, or woodlots, combining trees, shrubs, and field crops in multistoried cropping systems, and growing crops between rows of nitrogen-fixing trees or shrubs (“alley cropping”). On the other hand, farmers also reported their engagement in tree planting campaigns in areas where there was no forest cover previously. In sub-Saharan Africa, afforestation programs have been implemented to combat deforestation and land degradation (Chomba et al., 2020). This is an effective traditional way of increasing soil cover, sequester carbon and mitigate the effects of climate change on rural agriculture. 4.4 Possible reasons for using traditional approaches to climate change adaptation Sub-Saharan African countries are incorporating traditional approaches to climate change adaptation due to their effectiveness and relevance to local conditions. Findings indicate that adopting traditional agricultural practices for climate change adaptation delivers multi-faceted benefits including enhancing soil quality and crop productivity by altering soil structure, promoting nutrient cycling, and reducing pests and diseases. Peoples and Baldock (2020) reported that crop rotation can increase the production of subsequent crops. Niggli et al. (2019) also stated that organic matter enhances soil resistance to drought and makes them adaptable to low and high rainfall conditions. Famers reported that improving over soil health, soil organic matter and crop yield, reducing greenhouse gas emission and enhancing resilience against climate variability are the major reasons why they use traditional approaches such as use of organic manure, traditional organic composting, afforestation and agroforestry, among others. The utilization of these techniques highlights the importance of diversifying agricultural practices to enhance climate resilience, which can serve as a model for other regions grappling with similar challenges. For instance, the successful implementation of afforestation and agroforestry initiatives in Southeast Nigeria as a means of enhancing the productivity of farming business demonstrates their potential as nature-based solutions to climate change that can be scaled up in similar agro-ecosystems. As climate change continues to pose challenges to agricultural systems across the continent, sharing and scaling up these effective practices can contribute significantly to building climate-resilient farming communities and ensuring food security for future generations in sub-Saharan Africa. 4.5 Constraints to adapting traditional agriculture to climate change Smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa face multifaceted challenges as they seek to adapt traditional agriculture to climate change. Lead farmers in the present study reported that poor agricultural extension services, pest and disease vulnerability, and inadequate dissemination of climate change information due to limited extension services are factors that hinder climate change adaptation, which corroborates the research conducted by Satishkumar et al. (2020). Studies in Nigeria and Ghana have highlighted constraints such as inadequate finance, scarcity of labor, inadequate access to climate information, and lack of access to weather information as significant barriers to farmers' efforts to adapt to climate change (Abegunde et al., 2019; Ige et al., 2021). Additionally, unpredictable weather conditions have been identified as a serious constraint to climate change adaptation strategies in Northern Ghana, affecting arable crop farmers' choice of adaptation strategies (Ige et al., 2021). On the other hand, findings showed that farmers do not have the knowledge to determine the level of accuracy of their climate information, because they never had real-time access to climate information. However, Fagariba et al. (2018) suggested that the inadequacy, inaccuracy, and inconsistency of climatic information available to farmers pose constraints in weather forecasting as an adaptation strategy to climate change. Furthermore, the high cost of accessing weather forecast information and its incompatibility with farmers' needs also hampers the adoption of weather forecasting as a reliable means of coping with the effects of climate change (Ojo et al., 2018). The result of the factor analysis resolved the constraints encountered by farmers into two components namely technical production and climate information problems. This is in tandem with the findings of Autio et al. (2021) who found that smallholder farmers in Southeast Kenya face challenges in adopting climate-smart agricultural practices due to limited access to productive resources and climate uncertainty. This is probably because formal climate adaptation strategies in sub-Saharan Africa often fail to consider the agency of smallholder farmers, leading to a disconnect between the strategies and the farmers' actual adaptation practices and needs. Addressing these constraints is crucial for the successful implementation of climate-smart agricultural practices and the resilience of agricultural systems in the region. 4.6 Possible strategies to adapt and mitigate the effect of climate change in traditional agricultural systems Climate change poses significant challenges to traditional agricultural systems in sub-Saharan Africa. Smallholder farmers in the region have been adapting to a changing climate, but there is a need for more comprehensive strategies to mitigate its effects. Farmers in the study area indicated that the use of climate-smart agriculture, the use of resistant crop varieties, afforestation, and other identified strategies can effectively mitigate the effects of climate change. This finding aligns with the research conducted by Ali et al. (2019), who highlighted the importance of using resistant crop varieties to adapt and build resilience to the effects of climate change. Resistant crops are known to survive and complete their life cycles even in adverse environmental conditions, providing a useful adaptation strategy (Barasa et al., 2021). Similarly, Jellason et al. (2022) indicated that on-farm adaptation options, agro-ecological intensification (AEI) practices, diversification and intercropping, adoption of improved crop varieties and soil and water management practices are crucial adaptation strategies to climate change in sub-Saharan Africa dry lands. The results further demonstrate that farmers have developed and tested various strategies to reduce the effects of climate change. This highlights their proactive approach to adopting measures to mitigate climate change and their ability to innovate and adapt to the changing environment. The results from the factor analysis categorized the strategies adopted by farmers into two categories namely agronomic methods and research methods for adaptation. Farmers indicated that adjusting the timing of farm operations, availability of extension services, incorporating crop residues into the soil, provision of mulching materials, infrastructure, and adoption of resistant crops and afforestation, are vital agronomic strategies to adapt traditional agriculture to climate change. In terms of the research methods to adaptations, farmers highlight the importance of proper seed conservation, availability of adequate farm inputs, and increased investment in agricultural research and development as crucial aspects to address in enhancing the resilience of their agricultural systems to climate change. 5 Conclusion This study provides valuable insights into the socioeconomic characteristics of farmers and their practices in adapting to climate change. The findings highlight the significant role of women in rural areas and their involvement in sustainable agriculture practices, as evidenced by a higher percentage of female respondents. The large household size and relatively low-income levels underscore the importance of agriculture as a primary source of livelihood for these farmers. Farmers have considerable experience addressing climate change issues, indicating their potential to collaborate and implement effective adaptation and mitigation strategies. However, the study also reveals the reliance on limited sources of climate change information, such as radio and fellow farmers, indicating the need for improved dissemination channels and access to diverse sources of knowledge. The study highlights the prevalent use of climate-smart traditional agricultural practices among indigenous people, including organic manure application and mixed farming, demonstrating farmers' proactive approach to mitigating the effects of climate change. These practices enhance soil fertility and moisture retention and improve crop productivity and resilience. Nevertheless, the study identifies constraints such as poor extension services, limited access to climate information, and technical challenges that hinder effective adaptation. These constraints require enhanced support systems, policy interventions, and agricultural research and development investments. In light of the findings, promoting climate-smart agriculture, the use of resistant crop varieties, afforestation, and sustainable farming practices emerge as essential strategies to mitigate the effects of climate change. By addressing the identified constraints and building upon farmers' existing knowledge and experiences, we can enhance their resilience, improve agricultural productivity, and contribute to sustainable rural development. 5.1 Policy implications of the findings • Strengthen extension services and diversify information sources: Governments should invest in and strengthen extension services to provide farmers with up-to-date climate change information, area-specific weather cues, agricultural best practices, and new technologies. And promote the use of diverse information sources, including indigenous channels, digital platforms and community-based knowledge sharing. • Promote climate-smart agricultural practices: Encourage the adoption of climate-smart agricultural practices through incentives, subsidies, and training programs.

Mbah3 1Department of Sustainability in Agriculture, Food Production and Food Technology, Hungarian University of Agricultural and Life Sciences, Godollo, Hungary 2Department of Agricultural Extension, University of Nigeria, Nsukka, Nigeria 3Department of Animal Science, University of Nigeria, Nsukka, Nigeria Introduction: Sub-Saharan Africa faces increasingly unpredictable and extreme weather patterns due to climate change, posing significant threats to food security and rural livelihoods. Traditional agriculture, deeply rooted in the region's history and culture, is particularly vulnerable to these changes. This study investigates the adaptation strategies of traditional agricultural farmers to climate change using southeast Nigeria as a microcosm of the broader challenges facing sub-Saharan Africa. Methods: Multistage sampling procedure was used to select 75 farmer group leaders in the study region. Cross-sectional data were collected through semi-structured interview schedules and focus group discussions. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and principal component analysis using Varimax rotated matrix. Results: Findings showed that farmers rely on face-to-face discussions with neighbors (76.0%), fellow farmers (66.7%), and radio (54.7%) as their primary sources of information on climate change. Results showed that traditional adaptation practices such as use of organic manure (x¯ = 3.89), traditional organic composting (x¯ = 3.80), afforestation (x¯ = 3.71), agroforestry (x¯ = 3.61) were the topmost traditional agricultural practices use to cushion the effect of climate change. Conserving the overall soil health, soil moisture retention, reducing CO2 emissions and maintaining crop productivity were the major reasons for using the traditional approaches. Climate-induced drought and high cost of accessing weather information (x¯ = 1.93), and inadequate funding (x¯ = 1.92), among others were the key constraints to adaptation. Discussion: Results showed that farmers prioritize agronomic manipulation and integrated research approaches as key strategies to adapting traditional agriculture to climate anomalies. Although farmers used their indigenous practices, continuous learning and improvement through capacity-building workshops and progress monitoring are essential for effective climate change adaptation. Policymakers should invest in promoting indigenous knowledge, provide access to credit for climate-resilient infrastructure, promote climate-smart agricultural practices and foster collaborative research as the cornerstone for sustainable rural development. 1 Introduction Sub-Saharan Africa, a vast and diverse region characterized by its rich cultural heritage and ecological variety, has long been recognized as a crucial battleground in the fight against climate change and its devastating consequences (Thompson et al., 2010). The region is particularly vulnerable to climate change, with multiple biophysical, political, and socioeconomic stresses interacting to affect rural communities, where agriculture is a major lifeline. Studies consistently predict decreased crop productivity, land degradation, high market prices, and negative impacts on livelihoods, exacerbating food insecurity in the region (Emediegwu et al., 2022; Oyelami et al., 2023). Climate change is intensifying food insecurity across sub-Saharan Africa, and leading to changes in yield and area growth, higher food prices, reduced calorie availability, and growing childhood malnutrition (Ringler et al., 2010). Salgado Baptista et al. (2022) projected the crop yield, especially in key staples, in the region to decline by 5–17% by 2050 due to rising temperatures and rainfall volatility. Successive weather shocks, such as droughts and floods, significantly raise food insecurity, particularly in countries where agricultural productivity is already below the global average (Salgado Baptista et al., 2022). With a predominantly agrarian economy dominated by stallholder farmers and a heavy reliance on traditional agricultural practices rooted in centuries of local knowledge and practices, the nations of sub-Saharan Africa are acutely vulnerable to the adverse impacts of a changing climate. Nigeria, as the most populous country in Africa, serves as a microcosm of the broader challenges and opportunities facing sub-Saharan Africa. It plays a pivotal role in the region's agricultural landscape and is emblematic of the broader climate adaptation issues faced by many nations in sub-Saharan Africa. Nigeria is estimated to contribute 14% of Africa's agriculture GDP, making it one of the top three African countries with the highest GDP contribution from agriculture (Oyaniran and Omomia, 2018). Between January and March 2021, agriculture contributed to 22.35% of Nigeria's GDP, with over 140 million Nigerians engaged in the sector mainly at a subsistence level. On formal level, more than 36% (above 28.9 million) of Nigeria's labor force was employed in agriculture, with over 80% of the agricultural workforce being smallholder farmers (FAO, 2019; Mayong et al., 2021; International Trade Administration, 2023). Nigeria possesses an abundance of arable land and a favorable climate to produce various crops, including maize, cassava, guinea corn, yam, beans, millet, and rice (FAO, 2019). However, despite its significant contribution to the economy, Nigeria's agricultural sector faces formidable challenges such as climate change and climate-induced socio-economic stressors. These challenges have stifled agricultural productivity, affecting the sector's contribution to the country's GDP and leading to increased food imports due to population growth (FAO, 2019). The impacts of climate change in Nigeria are characterized by increasing climate variability, leading to more intense and untimely rainfall, land degradation, flash floods, landslides, and gully erosion (Ghosh, 2019; World Bank, 2022). By 2009, an estimated 6,000 gullies were destroying infrastructure, farmland, and real estate across rural and urban Nigeria, causing fear and despair among the population (World Bank, 2022). The climate change-induced losses and unsustainable use of resources have elevated themselves to a real development challenge in Nigeria, particularly along the coastal states in the south and the northern frontline states, thwarting the age-old rhythms of traditional agriculture which are rooted in centuries of local knowledge and practices. The negative impacts of climate change on Nigeria's agriculture have been observed predominantly in the northern, northeastern, southwestern and southeast regions, which experience extreme weather conditions (Tajudeen et al., 2022; World Bank, 2022). The loss of life and property due to sudden, unpredictable, and uncontrollable floods is a nightmare for many Nigerians, destroying crops, farms, lands, and houses. The agricultural sector, which is the country's economic mainstay, is also grappling with lower crop yields, food insecurity, deepening poverty, forced displacement, labor inefficiency due to high temperatures and conflicts due to drought, flooding, sea level rise, erosion, and rapid decline in earth's limiting resources (Brouziyne et al., 2018; Obaji et al., 2022; United Nations Development Programme, 2023). In 2022 alone, climate-induced pests and diseases insurgence caused crop losses of up to 80% in some areas, impacting 1.5–200,000 hectares of land, and more than 20% of crops experienced post-harvest losses in several states (Adegwu, 2022). Major crops affected included maize, rice, sorghum, millet, soybean, groundnut, cowpea, root and tubers, fruits, vegetables, and tree crops in 33 states (Adegwu, 2022; Rizzo et al., 2023). The country's tropical climate is characterized by high temperatures, humidity, and rainfall, with larger amounts of rainfall experienced in the south and southeast regions of the country. Wind patterns are influenced by Nigeria's location and topography, largely due to the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) which brings moist winds from the Atlantic Ocean during the wet season and dry winds from the Sahara Desert during the dry season (Dia et al., 2023), which influences the annual temperature. The Nigeria temperature records indicate an average increase of 1.4–1.9°C, with predictions of further increases of 2–5°C by the end of the century if no decisive action is taken (Brouziyne et al., 2018). Nigeria is already experiencing the adverse effects of climate change, as with natural disasters are occurring more frequently and with greater intensity. These multi-dimensional adverse effects have not only hampered the ability of the agricultural sector to meet the country's food demands but have also disrupted the traditional roles of agriculture in Nigeria's economy, leading to a shift from being a net food exporter to an importer (Onyeneke et al., 2021). The cumulative agricultural imports of the country stood at N3.35 trillion between 2016 and 2019, which was four times higher than the agricultural export of N803 billion within the same period (FAO, 2019). Therefore, it is crucial to explore and implement interdisciplinary adaptation strategies that can enhance the sustainability and resilience of agri-food systems to climate anomalies. Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) has emerged as a competent response to the challenges posed by climate change on agriculture in rural areas. It entails the integration of traditional agricultural practices with modern techniques. Traditional agriculture, rooted in indigenous knowledge, cultural beliefs, and sustainable practices, offers valuable insights into adapting agricultural systems to a changing climate (Tsado, 2019). The approach of CSA is recognized for its potential to enhance farm productivity and incomes, adaptation, and resilience to climate change in rural African context (Abegunde and Obi, 2022). CSA offers a comprehensive strategy for addressing the interconnected challenges faced by smallholder farmers in African countries, focusing on three core goals: increasing agricultural productivity, adapting and building resilience to climate change, and developing opportunities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture (Obaji et al., 2022). Additionally, the FAO emphasizes that CSA is an approach that helps guide actions to transform agri-food systems toward green and climate-resilient practices, addressing challenges related to climate change and agriculture (FAO, 2023). However, CSA is not a one-size-fits-all approach and requires tailoring to specific climate risks faced by different farming communities, regions, and ecosystems. While CSA offers a solution to many of the secondary and tertiary problems caused by climate shocks, it is still not a familiar solution to climate adaptation and mitigation in last-mile communities. The effective utilization of CSA at grassroots is not just about understanding “how its works” but in appreciating the intricate web of cultural, economic, ecological, and technological factors that influence this adaptation tactics. Rural communities in sub-Saharan Africa are adapting their traditional agriculture to climate change through a variety of strategies and practices. Indigenous peoples and local communities are leveraging traditional knowledge and improved crop varieties to cope with extreme weather and environmental changes caused by climate change (Swiderska, 2011). Traditional agricultural practices, which have been developed over centuries, are proving to be valuable in building resilience and adapting to the impacts of climate change (Singh and Singh, 2017). Adjustments in planting dates, crop varieties, drainage systems, using advanced technologies and land management regimes to maintain yields and soil fertility (Arbuckle et al., 2015), are crucial on-the-ground strategies used by local farmers to counter the adverse effects of climatic changes. Traditional practices, such as agroforestry, intercropping, crop rotation, cover cropping, traditional organic composting, and integrated crop-animal farming, have demonstrated the potential to improve crop productivity and mitigate climate change impacts (Tripathi et al., 2019; Mashi et al., 2022). These practices, honed over thousands of years by indigenous farmers and local communities, provide valuable adaptation strategies in the face of climate uncertainties. Traditional agricultural practices have the potential to adapt and mitigate climate change through its unique agroecological features. They increase agrobiodiversity and resilience of agroecosystems, are low-cost, energy-efficient, and based on locally available resources (Singh and Singh, 2017). It is characterized by high productivity, biodiversity conservation, low energy inputs, and climate change mitigation (Singh and Singh, 2017). Therefore, integrating traditional knowledge into climate change policies is seen as a cost-effective, climate-smart approach and sustainable adaptation strategy to climate variability. While there is a growing recognition of the role of traditional knowledge in adapting agriculture to climate change, the role of indigenous knowledge and adaptive practices remains largely undervalued by decision-makers. Negotiating parties in international climate talks tend to focus on intensifying production through modern agriculture, overlooking the potential of traditional knowledge in adaptation (Swiderska, 2011). The unsustainable transition from traditional agriculture to modern methods in rural communities has led to the loss of crop genetic resources and environmental sustainability challenges, exacerbating the effects of climate change. Therefore, there is an urgent need to rediscover and re-implement traditional agricultural practices while integrating them with modern approaches to enhance the socio-ecological integrity of agroecosystems (Shittu et al., 2021). Ricart et al. (2023) analyzed a portfolio of 435 articles collected from WoS and Scopus databases between 2010 and 2020, finding that farmers are in a favorable position to offer first-hand observations and provide a deeper understanding of climate change manifestation, relevance, effects, and narratives. Therefore, farmers' knowledge provides a framework for appraising and incorporating new ideas, experiences, and information into existing systems (Haradhan, 2017). This study explored the adaptation strategies employed by farmers to mitigate the impacts of climate change on their indigenous agricultural system using southeast Nigeria as a model region for all riparian regions in sub-Saharan Africa. The specific objective of the study entails identifying the key climate change information sources by farmers; elicit the effective traditional adaptation practices farmers use to cushion the effect of climate change; examine the possible reasons for using traditional approaches to climate change adaptation, identify the constraints to adaptation, and the effective strategies to adapt and mitigate the effect of climate change. The grand objective of the study is to provide grassroots insights and recommendations for fostering sustainability and climate-resilient agri-food systems in sub-Saharan Africa. 2 Methodology The study was carried out in Southeast Nigeria, specifically within the geographical coordinates of latitudes 04° 17′N and 07° 06′N and longitudes 05° 23′E and 09° 28′E, as described in Macmillian's 2009 report. This region covers an area spanning 29,908 square kilometers and is inhabited by ~16,381,729 people, according to the Nigeria. National Bureau of Statistics (2007). It encompasses the territories of Abia state, Anambra state, Ebonyi state, Enugu state, and Imo state (see Figure 1). The climate of the Southeast can be broadly characterized as tropical, featuring distinct wet and dry seasons. It falls within the tropical belt, with early rainfall typically occurring in January/February and the full onset of the rainy season in March, concluding in November each year. The dry season typically lasts for 4–5 months, with the highest rainfall occurring from July to October, with a slight respite in August. On average, the region experiences an annual rainfall of ~1,952 mm, and the mean daily and annual temperatures are around 28 and 27°C, respectively (Igbokwe et al., 2008). Southeast Nigeria is primarily an agricultural area, with predominantly sandy and often loose and porous soil types. The most commonly cultivated crops in this region include cassava, rice, yam, cocoyam, maize, plantain/banana, cashew, oil palm, and coconut. Additionally, the major livestock raised in the area consist of goats, sheep, and poultry. In the southeastern region, the effects of climate change are readily noticeable, manifested in increased instances of flooding, landslides, and erosion, which have resulted in the loss of lives, homes, farmlands, properties, and roads, among other adverse consequences (Agwu and Okhimamhe, 2009). Figure 1 Figure 1. Map of southeast Nigeria. Source: Macmillian Atlas Series 2009. The population for the study comprised all farmers and relevant stakeholders operating in difficult-to-reach communities in the study region. Respondents were selected using a multi-stage sampling procedure. In the first stage, the five states that make up the Southeast Nigeria were selected purposefully to have good spread and depth of data and local perspectives. In the second stage, three senatorial zones were randomly selected in each state, given a total of 15 senatorial zones. In the third stage, five representative lead-farmers each were randomly selected from each of the 15 senatorial zones, given a total of 75 farmers used for the study. Data were collected using a semi-structure interview schedule and focus group discussion based on the specific objectives. The reliability of the instrument was tested using the Cronbach Alpha coefficient for internal consistency. The instrument was validated by experts in the Department of Agricultural Extension, University of Nigeria, Nsukka. Personal data, such as age (in years), gender (male or female), marital status (single, married, divorced/separated, and widowed), education (number of years spent in school), farming experience (years), household size (number of persons currently in the household), household monthly income (naira), estimated annual earnings (naira), access to extension service (number of times in the past 1 year), membership to the social organization(s), and access to credit facilities, were collected. Sources of information on climate change were collected by asking respondents to tick “Yes” or “No” from a list of information sources. Data on the effective traditional adaptation practices used to cushion the effects of climate change were collected by providing a list of perceived traditional practices. Respondents were required to rate the effective adaptive practices on a four-point Likert-type scale of very effective (4), effective (3), a little effective (2) and not effective (1). A mean score (2.5) was obtained. Variables with a mean score ≥2.5 were regarded as effective practices. Information on possible reasons for using traditional approaches for climate change adaptation were obtained by providing a list of variables for the respondents. Respondents were asked to rank the importance of traditional practices to their climate adaptation from a list of practices on a 3-point Likert scale of very important (3), important (2) and not important (1). A mean score (2) was obtained and all the variables with mean score ≥2 were regarded as important to adaptive capacity. Data on constraints to adaptation and mitigation were collected by asking the respondents to rank their constraints on a 3-point Likert scale of major constraint (2), minor constraint (1), not a constraint (0)—with a mean score of one. Data on the effectiveness of the strategies to mitigate the effect of climate change was measured by asking respondents to choose from a list of variables provided. Their responses were captured on a four-point Likert-type scale of very effective (4), effective (3), little effective (2), and not effective (1). A mean score (2.5) was obtained. Responses with a mean score ≥2.5 were regarded as effective. Excerpts from semi structure interviews and focus group discussions were reported in the result section of the article. Data obtained were analyzed with descriptive statistics (percentages, mean, and standard deviation) and principal component analysis using Varimax rotated factors analysis—through the IBM SPSS Statistics version 21 software. 3 Results 3.1 Socioeconomic characteristics of the farmers According to Table 1, results reveal that 52.0% of the respondents were female, while 48.0% were male. Regarding age distribution, most respondents (28.0%) fell within the 31–40 age range. Approximately 24.0% were aged between 41 and 50, 20.0% were 60 and above, and 18.7% were 30 and below. Only 9.3% were between 51 and 60 years old. The mean age of the farmers was 46.11, suggesting the active participation of middle-aged individuals in traditional agriculture. Regarding household size, a significant proportion (72.0%) of respondents had a household size of 5–8 persons, while 12.0% had 1–4 persons, and 16.0% had 8 or more persons. The results also indicate that the mean monthly household income was ₦20,093.33. Table 1 Table 1. Socioeconomic characteristics of the respondents (n = 75). 3.2 Sources of information by farmers on climate change adaptation The results in Table 2 indicate that most (76.0%) respondents obtain information on climate change, adaptation, and mitigation through face-to-face discussions with neighbors. This implies that community-based community approaches could be highly effective in disseminating information about climate change. Leveraging indigenous communication channels such as implementing community meetings or local discussion groups could be a strategic way to spread awareness and knowledge on climate adaptation and mitigation measures. Additionally, 66.7% of the respondents acquired information from fellow farmers. This implies that farmers probably trust and value the experiences and knowledge of their peers. Programs that engage local farmers as educators or facilitators could leverage this trust and peer influence for effective communication on climate resilience building. The reliance on radio by more than half 54.7% of respondents highlights its importance as a traditional but still relevant medium, especially in areas where digital connectivity might be limited. Radio programs focused on climate change, featuring expert advice, success stories from other farmers, and practical tips for adaptation and mitigation, could be a very effective outreach tool. Other information sources include videos (29.3%), newsletters on climate change (22.7%), internet (21.3%), television (20.0%), and among others. The variety of climate change information sources used by farmers underscores the need for a multi-channel communication strategy—since informal channels (neighbors and fellow farmers) could brood risk of misinformation or incomplete information being circulated. Table 2 Table 2. Source of information of farmers on climate changes (n = 75). 3.3 Effective traditional adaptation practices farmers use to cushion the effect of climate change In Table 3 show the traditional adaptation practices farmers use to cushion the effect of climate change. The traditional adaptation practices used include use of organic manure (x¯ = 3.89), traditional organic composting (x¯ = 3.80), afforestation (x¯ = 3.71), agroforestry (x¯ = 3.61), crop rotation (x¯ = 3.40), and mulching (x¯ = 3.37). These practices not only help in adapting to climate change but also contribute to mitigating its effects by enhancing carbon sequestration and biodiversity. For instance, the use of organic manure by the study participants is due to their accessibility, cost-effectiveness, or perceived effectiveness in improving soil health and resilience against climate variability. Excerpts from the focus group discussion indicate that farmers unanimously agree that [“…they use organic manure due to their accessibility, cost-effectiveness, or perceived effectiveness in improving soil health and resilience against climate variability…”]. Hence, these practices indicate a level of knowledge and adaptation to local climatic conditions. Table 3 Table 3. Traditional adaptation practices farmers use to cushion the effect of climate change (n = 75). Other traditional adaptation practices include intercropping (x¯ = 3.36), planting of cover crops and irrigation (x¯ = 3.29), integrated crop-animal farming (x¯ = 3.21), bush fallow practices (x¯ = 3.13), and among others. The use of intercropping and integrated crop-animal farming implies that indigenous people and communities prioritizes diversification as a key risk management strategy against the backdrop of climate change. Additionally, the use of irrigation, bush fallowing and covering crops indicates an awareness of and response to the need for optimal resource utilization, maintenance of soil health and sustainability, which is crucial for long-term agricultural productivity in the face of climate change. 3.4 Possible reasons for using traditional approaches to climate change adaptation Table 4 presents the key reasons for using traditional approaches to climate change adaptation. The reasons identified include increased soil fertility (x¯ = 2.95), aeration of soil (x¯ = 2.85), reduction of soil erosion (x¯ = 2.73), increase in soil moisture (x¯ = 2.03), enhancement of soil structure and aggregation (x¯ = 2.79), promotion of mineralization of nitrogen-containing compounds in the soil through the use of leguminous crops (x¯ = 2.68), reduction of nutrient loss from the soil (x¯ = 2.73), reduction of chemical pollution in the soil (x¯ = 2.33), and enhancement of agro-biodiversity through intercropping of legumes (x¯ = 2.56). This implies that farmers are aware of the importance of soil health in sustainable farming and climate change adaptation. This reflects a desire to maintain sustainable, eco-friendly farming practices that not only benefit the current crop but also contribute to the long-term health of the farm ecosystem. The reliance on traditional methods to deliver these benefits indicates a strong base of traditional agricultural knowledge and practices well-suited to local environmental conditions that have been passed down through generations. While these traditional practices are beneficial, there is potential for enhancing their effectiveness through the integration of scientific research and modern agricultural techniques. Table 4 Table 4. Possible reasons for using traditional approaches to climate change adaptation. 3.5 Constraints to adapting traditional agriculture to climate change Table 5 presents the constraints identified by the respondents to the use of traditional adaptation strategies. The major constraints to adaptation include climate variation leading to drought and high cost of accessing weather information (x¯ = 1.93), and inadequate funding (x¯ = 1.92). Access to micro-climate cues and finances are crucial in building local adaptation strategies. High cost of accessing reliable weather information frustrates traditional adaptive measures, making it difficult for farmers to plan and make informed climate-smart decisions effectively. It is therefore imperative to provide a more accessible, affordable, and accurate weather forecasting services tailored for farmers alongside financial assistance programs, subsidies, or microfinance solutions targeted at smallholder farmers. Participants also indicated that lack of technical knowledge and know-how (x¯ = 1.89) pose a major challenge to adapt. Mrs. Ngozika, a rural farmer from the study participant stated thus [“…I do not know the practical steps I could take to improve my farm activities in this era of climate change…”]. This implies a gap in the knowledge and skills necessary to implement effective adaptation strategies, which could probably be due to inadequate extension services or training programs. Inadequate infrastructure (x¯ = 1.87), such as roads and storage facilities, limits the ability of farmers to adapt to and mitigate the impacts of climate change. There is a need for governmental and non-governmental bodies to invest in rural infrastructure to support agricultural activities. Also, inadequate access to climate change information (x¯ = 1.85) present a formidable obstacle to rural adaptive capacities. This aligns with the high cost of accessing weather information and highlights a broader issue of information accessibility. Vulnerability to pests and diseases (x¯ = 1.83) resulting from climate change bedevils farmers adaptation efforts. Therefore, research into and promotion of climate-resilient crop varieties and integrated pest management practices are crucial for traditional agricultural systems. Other constraints faced by farmers include inadequate credit facilities (x¯ = 1.79), poor agricultural program and service delivery (x¯ = 1.69), high economic losses from farming (x¯ = 1.65), among others. Table 5 Table 5. Constraints to adaptation. Table 6 presents the results of the factor analysis of the constraints to adaptation. The variables with a loading of 0.4 score and above were included in naming the factors. Variables that loaded in more than one factor or had loadings below 0.4 were not used. Two key factors were identified and named: a technical problem (Factor 1) and a climate information problem (Factor 2). Under the technical problem (Factor 1), the major constraints identified by farmers include poor agricultural program and service delivery (loading = 0.768), high cost of farm operations (loading = 0.663), lack of skilled laboratory facilities for farm practices (loading = 0.650), inconsistent government policies (loading = 0.580), lack of extension services for providing information to farmers (loading = 0.539), high economic losses from farming (loading = 0.500), and vulnerability to pests and diseases (loading = 0.487). In Factor 2, the climate informational problem includes the high cost of accessing weather information (loading = 0.692) and drought climate variation (loading = 0.515). The factor analysis provides a clear framework for understanding the complex array of challenges in agricultural adaptation, emphasizing the need for comprehensive, well-coordinated responses that address both immediate technical issues and longer-term climate information accessibility challenges. Table 6 Table 6. Varimax rotated factors on constraints to adaptation. 3.6 Possible strategies to adapt and mitigate the effect of climate change Table 7 presents the respondents' responses regarding adopting respective mitigation measures. The major strategies adopted by farmers include the use of organic manure (x¯ = 3.87), use of resistant crops (score x¯ = 3.85), use of drought-resistant crops (x¯ = 3.68), and use of flood-tolerant crops (x¯ = 3.73). Farmers can adopt resistant crop varieties that are better suited to withstand the impacts of climate change, such as drought, extreme temperatures, and pests. Also, afforestation (planting trees; x¯ = 3.67), and use of use of cover crops (x¯ = 3.47) are important strategies to adapt and mitigate the effect of climate change. Excerpts from the focus group discussion indicate that farmers unanimously agree that [“…Planting palm, orange, and gmelina help remove climate pollutants from the atmosphere, contribute to climate change mitigation and provide additional benefits such as soil conservation and biodiversity enhancement…”]. Furthermore, the participant indicated access to reliable weather forecasting services (x¯ = 3.86) could help farmers make informed decisions and adapt their farming practices to changing climate conditions, thereby mitigating risks associated with irregular rainfall patterns. Famers also indicated that climate-smart agriculture practices (x¯ = 3.93) are important adaptation strategies. Implementing climate-smart agricultural practices, such as conservation tillage, diversified crop rotations, and rotational grazing, could effectively mitigate climate change impacts by sequestering carbon and enhancing soil health. Table 7 Table 7. Possible strategies to adopt and mitigate the effect of climate change (n = 75). Other important strategies identified by the respondents include incorporation of residues into the soil (x¯ = 3.23), proper conservation of seeds (x¯ = 3.75), provision of adequate mulching materials (x¯ = 3.40), among others. These strategies align with the principles of climate-resilient agriculture, which aims to enhance the adaptive capacity of agricultural systems and reduce their vulnerability to climate change while contributing to climate change mitigation. Table 8 shows the Varimax rotated factors of possible strategies to adopt and mitigate the effect of climate change. Variables that had loadings of 0.4 and above being included in naming the factors. Variables that loaded in more than one factor or had loadings below 0.4 were not used. Two factors were identified and named: agronomic methods (Factor 1) and research methods (Factor 2). Under the agronomic methods (Factor 1), the major strategies identified by farmers include changing the timing of farm operations (loading = 0.777), availability of extension service delivery (loading = 0.774), incorporation of residues into the soil (loading = 0.738), provision of adequate mulching materials (loading = 0.674), provision of infrastructure (loading = 0.550), use of resistant crops (loading = 0.535), and afforestation (loading = 0.414). In Factor 2, the research methods, the strategies identified are proper conservation of seeds (loading = 0.580), provision of adequate farm input supplies (loading = 0.437), and increased investment in agricultural research and development (loading = 0.424). Table 8 Table 8. Varimax rotated factors of possible strategies to adopt and mitigate the effect of climate change. 4 Discussion 4.1 Demographic characteristics of the farmers The United Nations reports that households in three Sub-Saharan African countries have an average of over 6 members each. Senegal stands out with one of the largest household sizes in Africa, averaging 10.8 members (United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division, 2019). These significant household sizes in Sub-Saharan Africa contribute to a valuable pool of labor for agricultural activities. The substantial household sizes in sub-Saharan Africa serve as a valuable labor reservoir for agricultural activities. Mr. Ode, a rural farmer said […I cannot afford machineries hence I use local labor, often involving family and friends…]. Compared to other regions such as North America and Europe, sub-Saharan Africa has larger average household size of 6.9 (Galal, 2023; Pew Research Center, 2023). This aligns with the result of this study of a mean household size of 6.43 people, indicating the families are relatively large and can contribute as a source of labor for farming activities. Thereby giving room for farming household to spend their extra income on other adaptive expenses. The empirical evidence from Swaziland underscored that sub-Saharan African countries could bear the brunt of climate change in terms of increased incidence of poverty and economic decline, with potential impacts on household welfare (Sam et al., 2021). The decrease in agricultural production due to the effects of climate change is a key contributing factor to farmers' reduced income. Findings showed that farmers have relatively low-income, indicating their reliance on income generated from the sales of their agricultural produce. This aligns firmly with related studies from sub-Saharan Africa (Ayanlade et al., 2018; Steinert et al., 2018; Ogada et al., 2020; Nwonu et al., 2022), which indicated that farmers within the region rely on personal savings. Farming experience is crucial to building climate resilience in traditional farming systems. Findings show that farmers have an average farming experience of 21.88 years, this implies that farmers in sub-Saharan Africa possess considerable experience addressing climate change issues in their farming practices, including adaptation and mitigation strategies (Sani and Chalchisa, 2016). However, support from governments and other organizations is crucial to enhance farmers' adaptation capacity and improve their access to resources and information. 4.2 Sources of information by farmers on climate change adaptation Smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa heavily rely on the environment for their livelihoods, making climate change adaptation crucial for their resilience. To achieve this, timely information on climate change adaptation strategies is vital. Although, there is limited information on the trend in climate information sources in sub-Saharan Africa. However, a study on smallholder farmers' climate resilience in Malawi and Ghana suggests that the relevance of information sources on climate change resilience is place-specific, and some sources may impede resilience (Amoak et al., 2023). Findings from the present study showed that across various survey regions, the main avenues through which individuals access information about climate change prominently include radio broadcasts, interactions with fellow farmers, and in-person discussions with neighbors. This widespread pattern of information dissemination aligns with the findings of multiple studies conducted not only in Anambra, as highlighted by Nwabugwu et al. (2019) and Uzochukwu et al. (2021), but also in diverse sub-Saharan African contexts. One of the noteworthy aspects of this information-sharing framework is the pivotal role of radio as a powerful and accessible medium for effectively communicating climate-related knowledge to diverse target groups across the region. According to and Antwi-Agyei et al. (2021) radio has proven to be a versatile tool in disseminating climate change information to both rural and urban communities, bridging information gaps, and promoting awareness and understanding of climate-related challenges. Additionally, community radio stations have been recognized for their ability to reach huge audiences and disseminate location-specific weather reporting, making them an effective tool for sharing climate information (Harvey et al., 2019; Global Center on Adaptation, 2023). This underscores the significance of radio as a primary and trusted source of climate-related information in sub-Saharan Africa. In addition to radio, the significance of peer interactions, particularly with fellow farmers and neighboring community members, emerges as a vital information source in the present study. A study on farmers' social networks and regional spillover effects in agricultural climate change mitigation emphasizes the positive influence of peer interactions on farmers' uptake of climate change adaptation measures (Kreft et al., 2023). Furthermore, a systematic review of smallholder farmers' climate change adaptation in sub-Saharan African indicated that knowledge integration and sharing within farming communities is important for adaptation to climate change (Jellason et al., 2022). This interpersonal exchange of knowledge within farming communities fosters the sharing of practical experiences, locally relevant adaptation strategies, and mitigation measures. Farmers can learn from one another's successes and challenges, making peer interactions a crucial component of climate change education and resilience-building efforts. It is important to acknowledge that while these channels are prevalent, there are variations in their prominence and effectiveness across sub-Saharan Africa's diverse regions and cultural contexts. 4.3 Effective traditional adaptation practices farmers use to cushion the effect of climate change Traditional adaptation practices are crucial for enhancing the climate change resilience of smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa. Findings show that all the tested traditional practices have high adoption rates as farmers utilize them to mitigate and adapt to climate change to minimize its effects. This aligns with the findings of the Crace (2019), which revealed that rural farmers have developed various strategies to reduce the impact of climate change, and these strategies have been tested and proven effective, reflecting farmers' perceptions and serving as effective mitigation and adaptation strategies. The increased application of organic manure by farmers serves multiple purposes, including enhancing soil fertility sustainably and increasing soil moisture content. Farmers noted that with rising temperatures and increased evapotranspiration caused by climate change, preserving moisture for crop use is crucial, making organic manure, planting of cover crops, bush fallow and mulching preferred options. They also emphasized that organic manure is cost-effective and readily available compared to inorganic fertilizers. This aligns with the findings of Quarshie et al. (2023) that traditional agricultural practitioners in sub-Saharan Africa implement on-farm adaptation options such as water management, and soil conservation techniques to combat climate change. Results showed that farmers deployed crop rotation, mixed cropping, intercropping, integrated crop-animal irrigation practices and shifting cultivation as key traditional soil and water management practices to adapt food crop production to climate change (Olumba et al., 2020; Benhin, 2021). This aligns with the findings of Naazie et al. (2023) who found that rural farmers in Ghana use crop diversification, intercropping, mixed farming and the adoption of improved crop varieties to adapt their agricultural production to climate change. Afforestation and agroforestry are important practices for promoting sustainable land use and mitigating the effects of climate change in sub-Saharan Africa. Results from the present study showed that farmers used afforestation and agroforestry techniques as an effective adaptation strategy as opposed mitigation strategy. These offers one of the most promising technological options for reversing soil degradation, restoring tree cover, and improving agricultural productivity in Africa. Famers reported the key agroforestry practices that helped them to adapt their agricultural system to climate change to include grazing or farming under savanna trees, growing coffee or cocoa under shade trees, planting fruit trees, sowing tree seeds on fallow land to speed up the restoration of fertility, planting “living” fences, windbreaks, or woodlots, combining trees, shrubs, and field crops in multistoried cropping systems, and growing crops between rows of nitrogen-fixing trees or shrubs (“alley cropping”). On the other hand, farmers also reported their engagement in tree planting campaigns in areas where there was no forest cover previously. In sub-Saharan Africa, afforestation programs have been implemented to combat deforestation and land degradation (Chomba et al., 2020). This is an effective traditional way of increasing soil cover, sequester carbon and mitigate the effects of climate change on rural agriculture. 4.4 Possible reasons for using traditional approaches to climate change adaptation Sub-Saharan African countries are incorporating traditional approaches to climate change adaptation due to their effectiveness and relevance to local conditions. Findings indicate that adopting traditional agricultural practices for climate change adaptation delivers multi-faceted benefits including enhancing soil quality and crop productivity by altering soil structure, promoting nutrient cycling, and reducing pests and diseases. Peoples and Baldock (2020) reported that crop rotation can increase the production of subsequent crops. Niggli et al. (2019) also stated that organic matter enhances soil resistance to drought and makes them adaptable to low and high rainfall conditions. Famers reported that improving over soil health, soil organic matter and crop yield, reducing greenhouse gas emission and enhancing resilience against climate variability are the major reasons why they use traditional approaches such as use of organic manure, traditional organic composting, afforestation and agroforestry, among others. The utilization of these techniques highlights the importance of diversifying agricultural practices to enhance climate resilience, which can serve as a model for other regions grappling with similar challenges. For instance, the successful implementation of afforestation and agroforestry initiatives in Southeast Nigeria as a means of enhancing the productivity of farming business demonstrates their potential as nature-based solutions to climate change that can be scaled up in similar agro-ecosystems. As climate change continues to pose challenges to agricultural systems across the continent, sharing and scaling up these effective practices can contribute significantly to building climate-resilient farming communities and ensuring food security for future generations in sub-Saharan Africa. 4.5 Constraints to adapting traditional agriculture to climate change Smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa face multifaceted challenges as they seek to adapt traditional agriculture to climate change. Lead farmers in the present study reported that poor agricultural extension services, pest and disease vulnerability, and inadequate dissemination of climate change information due to limited extension services are factors that hinder climate change adaptation, which corroborates the research conducted by Satishkumar et al. (2020). Studies in Nigeria and Ghana have highlighted constraints such as inadequate finance, scarcity of labor, inadequate access to climate information, and lack of access to weather information as significant barriers to farmers' efforts to adapt to climate change (Abegunde et al., 2019; Ige et al., 2021). Additionally, unpredictable weather conditions have been identified as a serious constraint to climate change adaptation strategies in Northern Ghana, affecting arable crop farmers' choice of adaptation strategies (Ige et al., 2021). On the other hand, findings showed that farmers do not have the knowledge to determine the level of accuracy of their climate information, because they never had real-time access to climate information. However, Fagariba et al. (2018) suggested that the inadequacy, inaccuracy, and inconsistency of climatic information available to farmers pose constraints in weather forecasting as an adaptation strategy to climate change. Furthermore, the high cost of accessing weather forecast information and its incompatibility with farmers' needs also hampers the adoption of weather forecasting as a reliable means of coping with the effects of climate change (Ojo et al., 2018). The result of the factor analysis resolved the constraints encountered by farmers into two components namely technical production and climate information problems. This is in tandem with the findings of Autio et al. (2021) who found that smallholder farmers in Southeast Kenya face challenges in adopting climate-smart agricultural practices due to limited access to productive resources and climate uncertainty. This is probably because formal climate adaptation strategies in sub-Saharan Africa often fail to consider the agency of smallholder farmers, leading to a disconnect between the strategies and the farmers' actual adaptation practices and needs. Addressing these constraints is crucial for the successful implementation of climate-smart agricultural practices and the resilience of agricultural systems in the region. 4.6 Possible strategies to adapt and mitigate the effect of climate change in traditional agricultural systems Climate change poses significant challenges to traditional agricultural systems in sub-Saharan Africa. Smallholder farmers in the region have been adapting to a changing climate, but there is a need for more comprehensive strategies to mitigate its effects. Farmers in the study area indicated that the use of climate-smart agriculture, the use of resistant crop varieties, afforestation, and other identified strategies can effectively mitigate the effects of climate change. This finding aligns with the research conducted by Ali et al. (2019), who highlighted the importance of using resistant crop varieties to adapt and build resilience to the effects of climate change. Resistant crops are known to survive and complete their life cycles even in adverse environmental conditions, providing a useful adaptation strategy (Barasa et al., 2021). Similarly, Jellason et al. (2022) indicated that on-farm adaptation options, agro-ecological intensification (AEI) practices, diversification and intercropping, adoption of improved crop varieties and soil and water management practices are crucial adaptation strategies to climate change in sub-Saharan Africa dry lands. The results further demonstrate that farmers have developed and tested various strategies to reduce the effects of climate change. This highlights their proactive approach to adopting measures to mitigate climate change and their ability to innovate and adapt to the changing environment. The results from the factor analysis categorized the strategies adopted by farmers into two categories namely agronomic methods and research methods for adaptation. Farmers indicated that adjusting the timing of farm operations, availability of extension services, incorporating crop residues into the soil, provision of mulching materials, infrastructure, and adoption of resistant crops and afforestation, are vital agronomic strategies to adapt traditional agriculture to climate change. In terms of the research methods to adaptations, farmers highlight the importance of proper seed conservation, availability of adequate farm inputs, and increased investment in agricultural research and development as crucial aspects to address in enhancing the resilience of their agricultural systems to climate change. 5 Conclusion This study provides valuable insights into the socioeconomic characteristics of farmers and their practices in adapting to climate change. The findings highlight the significant role of women in rural areas and their involvement in sustainable agriculture practices, as evidenced by a higher percentage of female respondents. The large household size and relatively low-income levels underscore the importance of agriculture as a primary source of livelihood for these farmers. Farmers have considerable experience addressing climate change issues, indicating their potential to collaborate and implement effective adaptation and mitigation strategies. However, the study also reveals the reliance on limited sources of climate change information, such as radio and fellow farmers, indicating the need for improved dissemination channels and access to diverse sources of knowledge. The study highlights the prevalent use of climate-smart traditional agricultural practices among indigenous people, including organic manure application and mixed farming, demonstrating farmers' proactive approach to mitigating the effects of climate change. These practices enhance soil fertility and moisture retention and improve crop productivity and resilience. Nevertheless, the study identifies constraints such as poor extension services, limited access to climate information, and technical challenges that hinder effective adaptation. These constraints require enhanced support systems, policy interventions, and agricultural research and development investments. In light of the findings, promoting climate-smart agriculture, the use of resistant crop varieties, afforestation, and sustainable farming practices emerge as essential strategies to mitigate the effects of climate change. By addressing the identified constraints and building upon farmers' existing knowledge and experiences, we can enhance their resilience, improve agricultural productivity, and contribute to sustainable rural development. 5.1 Policy implications of the findings • Strengthen extension services and diversify information sources: Governments should invest in and strengthen extension services to provide farmers with up-to-date climate change information, area-specific weather cues, agricultural best practices, and new technologies. And promote the use of diverse information sources, including indigenous channels, digital platforms and community-based knowledge sharing. • Promote climate-smart agricultural practices: Encourage the adoption of climate-smart agricultural practices through incentives, subsidies, and training programs. Governments should support research and development in climate-resilient crop varieties and livestock breeds. • Increase investment in agricultural research: Allocate more funding to agricultural research and innovation to develop climate-resilient technologies, improved crop varieties, and sustainable farming practices. • Access to credit for climate-resilient infrastructure: Facilitate access to credit and financial services for farmers to invest in climate-resilient infrastructure, such as irrigation systems, drought-resistant seeds, and storage facilities. • Supportive policies and collaborative networks: Create a conducive policy environment that encourages sustainable agricultural practices and promotes collaboration among various stakeholders, including government agencies, NGOs, and research institutions. • Capacity-Building Workshops and Progress Monitoring: Organize capacity-building workshops and training programs for farmers, extension workers, and other stakeholders to enhance their knowledge and skills in climate adaptation and mitigation. And also implement regular progress monitoring and evaluation to assess the effectiveness of climate adaptation efforts. • Enabling Environment for Continuous Learning and Improvement: Foster an environment that promotes continuous learning and improvement in agricultural practices. Encourage farmers to experiment with new techniques and technologies while providing them with the necessary support and resources. • Collaboration among policymakers, researchers, and local communities: Promote collaboration and coordination among policymakers, researchers, and local communities to ensure that climate-resilient and sustainable agricultural practices are developed, disseminated, and adopted effectively.

Traditional agriculture, deeply rooted in the region's history and culture, is particularly vulnerable to these changes. This study investigates the adaptation strategies of traditional agricultural farmers to climate change using southeast Nigeria as a microcosm of the broader challenges facing sub-Saharan Africa. Methods: Multistage sampling procedure was used to select 75 farmer group leaders in the study region. Cross-sectional data were collected through semi-structured interview schedules and focus group discussions. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and principal component analysis using Varimax rotated matrix. Results: Findings showed that farmers rely on face-to-face discussions with neighbors (76.0%), fellow farmers (66.7%), and radio (54.7%) as their primary sources of information on climate change. Results showed that traditional adaptation practices such as use of organic manure (x¯ = 3.89), traditional organic composting (x¯ = 3.80), afforestation (x¯ = 3.71), agroforestry (x¯ = 3.61) were the topmost traditional agricultural practices use to cushion the effect of climate change. Conserving the overall soil health, soil moisture retention, reducing CO2 emissions and maintaining crop productivity were the major reasons for using the traditional approaches. Climate-induced drought and high cost of accessing weather information (x¯ = 1.93), and inadequate funding (x¯ = 1.92), among others were the key constraints to adaptation. Discussion: Results showed that farmers prioritize agronomic manipulation and integrated research approaches as key strategies to adapting traditional agriculture to climate anomalies. Although farmers used their indigenous practices, continuous learning and improvement through capacity-building workshops and progress monitoring are essential for effective climate change adaptation. Policymakers should invest in promoting indigenous knowledge, provide access to credit for climate-resilient infrastructure, promote climate-smart agricultural practices and foster collaborative research as the cornerstone for sustainable rural development. 1 Introduction Sub-Saharan Africa, a vast and diverse region characterized by its rich cultural heritage and ecological variety, has long been recognized as a crucial battleground in the fight against climate change and its devastating consequences (Thompson et al., 2010). The region is particularly vulnerable to climate change, with multiple biophysical, political, and socioeconomic stresses interacting to affect rural communities, where agriculture is a major lifeline. Studies consistently predict decreased crop productivity, land degradation, high market prices, and negative impacts on livelihoods, exacerbating food insecurity in the region (Emediegwu et al., 2022; Oyelami et al., 2023). Climate change is intensifying food insecurity across sub-Saharan Africa, and leading to changes in yield and area growth, higher food prices, reduced calorie availability, and growing childhood malnutrition (Ringler et al., 2010). Salgado Baptista et al. (2022) projected the crop yield, especially in key staples, in the region to decline by 5–17% by 2050 due to rising temperatures and rainfall volatility. Successive weather shocks, such as droughts and floods, significantly raise food insecurity, particularly in countries where agricultural productivity is already below the global average (Salgado Baptista et al., 2022). With a predominantly agrarian economy dominated by stallholder farmers and a heavy reliance on traditional agricultural practices rooted in centuries of local knowledge and practices, the nations of sub-Saharan Africa are acutely vulnerable to the adverse impacts of a changing climate. Nigeria, as the most populous country in Africa, serves as a microcosm of the broader challenges and opportunities facing sub-Saharan Africa. It plays a pivotal role in the region's agricultural landscape and is emblematic of the broader climate adaptation issues faced by many nations in sub-Saharan Africa. Nigeria is estimated to contribute 14% of Africa's agriculture GDP, making it one of the top three African countries with the highest GDP contribution from agriculture (Oyaniran and Omomia, 2018). Between January and March 2021, agriculture contributed to 22.35% of Nigeria's GDP, with over 140 million Nigerians engaged in the sector mainly at a subsistence level. On formal level, more than 36% (above 28.9 million) of Nigeria's labor force was employed in agriculture, with over 80% of the agricultural workforce being smallholder farmers (FAO, 2019; Mayong et al., 2021; International Trade Administration, 2023). Nigeria possesses an abundance of arable land and a favorable climate to produce various crops, including maize, cassava, guinea corn, yam, beans, millet, and rice (FAO, 2019). However, despite its significant contribution to the economy, Nigeria's agricultural sector faces formidable challenges such as climate change and climate-induced socio-economic stressors. These challenges have stifled agricultural productivity, affecting the sector's contribution to the country's GDP and leading to increased food imports due to population growth (FAO, 2019). The impacts of climate change in Nigeria are characterized by increasing climate variability, leading to more intense and untimely rainfall, land degradation, flash floods, landslides, and gully erosion (Ghosh, 2019; World Bank, 2022). By 2009, an estimated 6,000 gullies were destroying infrastructure, farmland, and real estate across rural and urban Nigeria, causing fear and despair among the population (World Bank, 2022). The climate change-induced losses and unsustainable use of resources have elevated themselves to a real development challenge in Nigeria, particularly along the coastal states in the south and the northern frontline states, thwarting the age-old rhythms of traditional agriculture which are rooted in centuries of local knowledge and practices. The negative impacts of climate change on Nigeria's agriculture have been observed predominantly in the northern, northeastern, southwestern and southeast regions, which experience extreme weather conditions (Tajudeen et al., 2022; World Bank, 2022). The loss of life and property due to sudden, unpredictable, and uncontrollable floods is a nightmare for many Nigerians, destroying crops, farms, lands, and houses. The agricultural sector, which is the country's economic mainstay, is also grappling with lower crop yields, food insecurity, deepening poverty, forced displacement, labor inefficiency due to high temperatures and conflicts due to drought, flooding, sea level rise, erosion, and rapid decline in earth's limiting resources (Brouziyne et al., 2018; Obaji et al., 2022; United Nations Development Programme, 2023). In 2022 alone, climate-induced pests and diseases insurgence caused crop losses of up to 80% in some areas, impacting 1.5–200,000 hectares of land, and more than 20% of crops experienced post-harvest losses in several states (Adegwu, 2022). Major crops affected included maize, rice, sorghum, millet, soybean, groundnut, cowpea, root and tubers, fruits, vegetables, and tree crops in 33 states (Adegwu, 2022; Rizzo et al., 2023). The country's tropical climate is characterized by high temperatures, humidity, and rainfall, with larger amounts of rainfall experienced in the south and southeast regions of the country. Wind patterns are influenced by Nigeria's location and topography, largely due to the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) which brings moist winds from the Atlantic Ocean during the wet season and dry winds from the Sahara Desert during the dry season (Dia et al., 2023), which influences the annual temperature. The Nigeria temperature records indicate an average increase of 1.4–1.9°C, with predictions of further increases of 2–5°C by the end of the century if no decisive action is taken (Brouziyne et al., 2018). Nigeria is already experiencing the adverse effects of climate change, as with natural disasters are occurring more frequently and with greater intensity. These multi-dimensional adverse effects have not only hampered the ability of the agricultural sector to meet the country's food demands but have also disrupted the traditional roles of agriculture in Nigeria's economy, leading to a shift from being a net food exporter to an importer (Onyeneke et al., 2021). The cumulative agricultural imports of the country stood at N3.35 trillion between 2016 and 2019, which was four times higher than the agricultural export of N803 billion within the same period (FAO, 2019). Therefore, it is crucial to explore and implement interdisciplinary adaptation strategies that can enhance the sustainability and resilience of agri-food systems to climate anomalies. Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) has emerged as a competent response to the challenges posed by climate change on agriculture in rural areas. It entails the integration of traditional agricultural practices with modern techniques. Traditional agriculture, rooted in indigenous knowledge, cultural beliefs, and sustainable practices, offers valuable insights into adapting agricultural systems to a changing climate (Tsado, 2019). The approach of CSA is recognized for its potential to enhance farm productivity and incomes, adaptation, and resilience to climate change in rural African context (Abegunde and Obi, 2022). CSA offers a comprehensive strategy for addressing the interconnected challenges faced by smallholder farmers in African countries, focusing on three core goals: increasing agricultural productivity, adapting and building resilience to climate change, and developing opportunities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture (Obaji et al., 2022). Additionally, the FAO emphasizes that CSA is an approach that helps guide actions to transform agri-food systems toward green and climate-resilient practices, addressing challenges related to climate change and agriculture (FAO, 2023). However, CSA is not a one-size-fits-all approach and requires tailoring to specific climate risks faced by different farming communities, regions, and ecosystems. While CSA offers a solution to many of the secondary and tertiary problems caused by climate shocks, it is still not a familiar solution to climate adaptation and mitigation in last-mile communities. The effective utilization of CSA at grassroots is not just about understanding “how its works” but in appreciating the intricate web of cultural, economic, ecological, and technological factors that influence this adaptation tactics. Rural communities in sub-Saharan Africa are adapting their traditional agriculture to climate change through a variety of strategies and practices. Indigenous peoples and local communities are leveraging traditional knowledge and improved crop varieties to cope with extreme weather and environmental changes caused by climate change (Swiderska, 2011). Traditional agricultural practices, which have been developed over centuries, are proving to be valuable in building resilience and adapting to the impacts of climate change (Singh and Singh, 2017). Adjustments in planting dates, crop varieties, drainage systems, using advanced technologies and land management regimes to maintain yields and soil fertility (Arbuckle et al., 2015), are crucial on-the-ground strategies used by local farmers to counter the adverse effects of climatic changes. Traditional practices, such as agroforestry, intercropping, crop rotation, cover cropping, traditional organic composting, and integrated crop-animal farming, have demonstrated the potential to improve crop productivity and mitigate climate change impacts (Tripathi et al., 2019; Mashi et al., 2022). These practices, honed over thousands of years by indigenous farmers and local communities, provide valuable adaptation strategies in the face of climate uncertainties. Traditional agricultural practices have the potential to adapt and mitigate climate change through its unique agroecological features. They increase agrobiodiversity and resilience of agroecosystems, are low-cost, energy-efficient, and based on locally available resources (Singh and Singh, 2017). It is characterized by high productivity, biodiversity conservation, low energy inputs, and climate change mitigation (Singh and Singh, 2017). Therefore, integrating traditional knowledge into climate change policies is seen as a cost-effective, climate-smart approach and sustainable adaptation strategy to climate variability. While there is a growing recognition of the role of traditional knowledge in adapting agriculture to climate change, the role of indigenous knowledge and adaptive practices remains largely undervalued by decision-makers. Negotiating parties in international climate talks tend to focus on intensifying production through modern agriculture, overlooking the potential of traditional knowledge in adaptation (Swiderska, 2011). The unsustainable transition from traditional agriculture to modern methods in rural communities has led to the loss of crop genetic resources and environmental sustainability challenges, exacerbating the effects of climate change. Therefore, there is an urgent need to rediscover and re-implement traditional agricultural practices while integrating them with modern approaches to enhance the socio-ecological integrity of agroecosystems (Shittu et al., 2021). Ricart et al. (2023) analyzed a portfolio of 435 articles collected from WoS and Scopus databases between 2010 and 2020, finding that farmers are in a favorable position to offer first-hand observations and provide a deeper understanding of climate change manifestation, relevance, effects, and narratives. Therefore, farmers' knowledge provides a framework for appraising and incorporating new ideas, experiences, and information into existing systems (Haradhan, 2017). This study explored the adaptation strategies employed by farmers to mitigate the impacts of climate change on their indigenous agricultural system using southeast Nigeria as a model region for all riparian regions in sub-Saharan Africa. The specific objective of the study entails identifying the key climate change information sources by farmers; elicit the effective traditional adaptation practices farmers use to cushion the effect of climate change; examine the possible reasons for using traditional approaches to climate change adaptation, identify the constraints to adaptation, and the effective strategies to adapt and mitigate the effect of climate change. The grand objective of the study is to provide grassroots insights and recommendations for fostering sustainability and climate-resilient agri-food systems in sub-Saharan Africa. 2 Methodology The study was carried out in Southeast Nigeria, specifically within the geographical coordinates of latitudes 04° 17′N and 07° 06′N and longitudes 05° 23′E and 09° 28′E, as described in Macmillian's 2009 report. This region covers an area spanning 29,908 square kilometers and is inhabited by ~16,381,729 people, according to the Nigeria. National Bureau of Statistics (2007). It encompasses the territories of Abia state, Anambra state, Ebonyi state, Enugu state, and Imo state (see Figure 1). The climate of the Southeast can be broadly characterized as tropical, featuring distinct wet and dry seasons. It falls within the tropical belt, with early rainfall typically occurring in January/February and the full onset of the rainy season in March, concluding in November each year. The dry season typically lasts for 4–5 months, with the highest rainfall occurring from July to October, with a slight respite in August. On average, the region experiences an annual rainfall of ~1,952 mm, and the mean daily and annual temperatures are around 28 and 27°C, respectively (Igbokwe et al., 2008). Southeast Nigeria is primarily an agricultural area, with predominantly sandy and often loose and porous soil types. The most commonly cultivated crops in this region include cassava, rice, yam, cocoyam, maize, plantain/banana, cashew, oil palm, and coconut. Additionally, the major livestock raised in the area consist of goats, sheep, and poultry. In the southeastern region, the effects of climate change are readily noticeable, manifested in increased instances of flooding, landslides, and erosion, which have resulted in the loss of lives, homes, farmlands, properties, and roads, among other adverse consequences (Agwu and Okhimamhe, 2009). Figure 1 Figure 1. Map of southeast Nigeria. Source: Macmillian Atlas Series 2009. The population for the study comprised all farmers and relevant stakeholders operating in difficult-to-reach communities in the study region. Respondents were selected using a multi-stage sampling procedure. In the first stage, the five states that make up the Southeast Nigeria were selected purposefully to have good spread and depth of data and local perspectives. In the second stage, three senatorial zones were randomly selected in each state, given a total of 15 senatorial zones. In the third stage, five representative lead-farmers each were randomly selected from each of the 15 senatorial zones, given a total of 75 farmers used for the study. Data were collected using a semi-structure interview schedule and focus group discussion based on the specific objectives. The reliability of the instrument was tested using the Cronbach Alpha coefficient for internal consistency. The instrument was validated by experts in the Department of Agricultural Extension, University of Nigeria, Nsukka. Personal data, such as age (in years), gender (male or female), marital status (single, married, divorced/separated, and widowed), education (number of years spent in school), farming experience (years), household size (number of persons currently in the household), household monthly income (naira), estimated annual earnings (naira), access to extension service (number of times in the past 1 year), membership to the social organization(s), and access to credit facilities, were collected. Sources of information on climate change were collected by asking respondents to tick “Yes” or “No” from a list of information sources. Data on the effective traditional adaptation practices used to cushion the effects of climate change were collected by providing a list of perceived traditional practices. Respondents were required to rate the effective adaptive practices on a four-point Likert-type scale of very effective (4), effective (3), a little effective (2) and not effective (1). A mean score (2.5) was obtained. Variables with a mean score ≥2.5 were regarded as effective practices. Information on possible reasons for using traditional approaches for climate change adaptation were obtained by providing a list of variables for the respondents. Respondents were asked to rank the importance of traditional practices to their climate adaptation from a list of practices on a 3-point Likert scale of very important (3), important (2) and not important (1). A mean score (2) was obtained and all the variables with mean score ≥2 were regarded as important to adaptive capacity. Data on constraints to adaptation and mitigation were collected by asking the respondents to rank their constraints on a 3-point Likert scale of major constraint (2), minor constraint (1), not a constraint (0)—with a mean score of one. Data on the effectiveness of the strategies to mitigate the effect of climate change was measured by asking respondents to choose from a list of variables provided. Their responses were captured on a four-point Likert-type scale of very effective (4), effective (3), little effective (2), and not effective (1). A mean score (2.5) was obtained. Responses with a mean score ≥2.5 were regarded as effective. Excerpts from semi structure interviews and focus group discussions were reported in the result section of the article. Data obtained were analyzed with descriptive statistics (percentages, mean, and standard deviation) and principal component analysis using Varimax rotated factors analysis—through the IBM SPSS Statistics version 21 software. 3 Results 3.1 Socioeconomic characteristics of the farmers According to Table 1, results reveal that 52.0% of the respondents were female, while 48.0% were male. Regarding age distribution, most respondents (28.0%) fell within the 31–40 age range. Approximately 24.0% were aged between 41 and 50, 20.0% were 60 and above, and 18.7% were 30 and below. Only 9.3% were between 51 and 60 years old. The mean age of the farmers was 46.11, suggesting the active participation of middle-aged individuals in traditional agriculture. Regarding household size, a significant proportion (72.0%) of respondents had a household size of 5–8 persons, while 12.0% had 1–4 persons, and 16.0% had 8 or more persons. The results also indicate that the mean monthly household income was ₦20,093.33. Table 1 Table 1. Socioeconomic characteristics of the respondents (n = 75). 3.2 Sources of information by farmers on climate change adaptation The results in Table 2 indicate that most (76.0%) respondents obtain information on climate change, adaptation, and mitigation through face-to-face discussions with neighbors. This implies that community-based community approaches could be highly effective in disseminating information about climate change. Leveraging indigenous communication channels such as implementing community meetings or local discussion groups could be a strategic way to spread awareness and knowledge on climate adaptation and mitigation measures. Additionally, 66.7% of the respondents acquired information from fellow farmers. This implies that farmers probably trust and value the experiences and knowledge of their peers. Programs that engage local farmers as educators or facilitators could leverage this trust and peer influence for effective communication on climate resilience building. The reliance on radio by more than half 54.7% of respondents highlights its importance as a traditional but still relevant medium, especially in areas where digital connectivity might be limited. Radio programs focused on climate change, featuring expert advice, success stories from other farmers, and practical tips for adaptation and mitigation, could be a very effective outreach tool. Other information sources include videos (29.3%), newsletters on climate change (22.7%), internet (21.3%), television (20.0%), and among others. The variety of climate change information sources used by farmers underscores the need for a multi-channel communication strategy—since informal channels (neighbors and fellow farmers) could brood risk of misinformation or incomplete information being circulated. Table 2 Table 2. Source of information of farmers on climate changes (n = 75). 3.3 Effective traditional adaptation practices farmers use to cushion the effect of climate change In Table 3 show the traditional adaptation practices farmers use to cushion the effect of climate change. The traditional adaptation practices used include use of organic manure (x¯ = 3.89), traditional organic composting (x¯ = 3.80), afforestation (x¯ = 3.71), agroforestry (x¯ = 3.61), crop rotation (x¯ = 3.40), and mulching (x¯ = 3.37). These practices not only help in adapting to climate change but also contribute to mitigating its effects by enhancing carbon sequestration and biodiversity. For instance, the use of organic manure by the study participants is due to their accessibility, cost-effectiveness, or perceived effectiveness in improving soil health and resilience against climate variability. Excerpts from the focus group discussion indicate that farmers unanimously agree that [“…they use organic manure due to their accessibility, cost-effectiveness, or perceived effectiveness in improving soil health and resilience against climate variability…”]. Hence, these practices indicate a level of knowledge and adaptation to local climatic conditions. Table 3 Table 3. Traditional adaptation practices farmers use to cushion the effect of climate change (n = 75). Other traditional adaptation practices include intercropping (x¯ = 3.36), planting of cover crops and irrigation (x¯ = 3.29), integrated crop-animal farming (x¯ = 3.21), bush fallow practices (x¯ = 3.13), and among others. The use of intercropping and integrated crop-animal farming implies that indigenous people and communities prioritizes diversification as a key risk management strategy against the backdrop of climate change. Additionally, the use of irrigation, bush fallowing and covering crops indicates an awareness of and response to the need for optimal resource utilization, maintenance of soil health and sustainability, which is crucial for long-term agricultural productivity in the face of climate change. 3.4 Possible reasons for using traditional approaches to climate change adaptation Table 4 presents the key reasons for using traditional approaches to climate change adaptation. The reasons identified include increased soil fertility (x¯ = 2.95), aeration of soil (x¯ = 2.85), reduction of soil erosion (x¯ = 2.73), increase in soil moisture (x¯ = 2.03), enhancement of soil structure and aggregation (x¯ = 2.79), promotion of mineralization of nitrogen-containing compounds in the soil through the use of leguminous crops (x¯ = 2.68), reduction of nutrient loss from the soil (x¯ = 2.73), reduction of chemical pollution in the soil (x¯ = 2.33), and enhancement of agro-biodiversity through intercropping of legumes (x¯ = 2.56). This implies that farmers are aware of the importance of soil health in sustainable farming and climate change adaptation. This reflects a desire to maintain sustainable, eco-friendly farming practices that not only benefit the current crop but also contribute to the long-term health of the farm ecosystem. The reliance on traditional methods to deliver these benefits indicates a strong base of traditional agricultural knowledge and practices well-suited to local environmental conditions that have been passed down through generations. While these traditional practices are beneficial, there is potential for enhancing their effectiveness through the integration of scientific research and modern agricultural techniques. Table 4 Table 4. Possible reasons for using traditional approaches to climate change adaptation. 3.5 Constraints to adapting traditional agriculture to climate change Table 5 presents the constraints identified by the respondents to the use of traditional adaptation strategies. The major constraints to adaptation include climate variation leading to drought and high cost of accessing weather information (x¯ = 1.93), and inadequate funding (x¯ = 1.92). Access to micro-climate cues and finances are crucial in building local adaptation strategies. High cost of accessing reliable weather information frustrates traditional adaptive measures, making it difficult for farmers to plan and make informed climate-smart decisions effectively. It is therefore imperative to provide a more accessible, affordable, and accurate weather forecasting services tailored for farmers alongside financial assistance programs, subsidies, or microfinance solutions targeted at smallholder farmers. Participants also indicated that lack of technical knowledge and know-how (x¯ = 1.89) pose a major challenge to adapt. Mrs. Ngozika, a rural farmer from the study participant stated thus [“…I do not know the practical steps I could take to improve my farm activities in this era of climate change…”]. This implies a gap in the knowledge and skills necessary to implement effective adaptation strategies, which could probably be due to inadequate extension services or training programs. Inadequate infrastructure (x¯ = 1.87), such as roads and storage facilities, limits the ability of farmers to adapt to and mitigate the impacts of climate change. There is a need for governmental and non-governmental bodies to invest in rural infrastructure to support agricultural activities. Also, inadequate access to climate change information (x¯ = 1.85) present a formidable obstacle to rural adaptive capacities. This aligns with the high cost of accessing weather information and highlights a broader issue of information accessibility. Vulnerability to pests and diseases (x¯ = 1.83) resulting from climate change bedevils farmers adaptation efforts. Therefore, research into and promotion of climate-resilient crop varieties and integrated pest management practices are crucial for traditional agricultural systems. Other constraints faced by farmers include inadequate credit facilities (x¯ = 1.79), poor agricultural program and service delivery (x¯ = 1.69), high economic losses from farming (x¯ = 1.65), among others. Table 5 Table 5. Constraints to adaptation. Table 6 presents the results of the factor analysis of the constraints to adaptation. The variables with a loading of 0.4 score and above were included in naming the factors. Variables that loaded in more than one factor or had loadings below 0.4 were not used. Two key factors were identified and named: a technical problem (Factor 1) and a climate information problem (Factor 2). Under the technical problem (Factor 1), the major constraints identified by farmers include poor agricultural program and service delivery (loading = 0.768), high cost of farm operations (loading = 0.663), lack of skilled laboratory facilities for farm practices (loading = 0.650), inconsistent government policies (loading = 0.580), lack of extension services for providing information to farmers (loading = 0.539), high economic losses from farming (loading = 0.500), and vulnerability to pests and diseases (loading = 0.487). In Factor 2, the climate informational problem includes the high cost of accessing weather information (loading = 0.692) and drought climate variation (loading = 0.515). The factor analysis provides a clear framework for understanding the complex array of challenges in agricultural adaptation, emphasizing the need for comprehensive, well-coordinated responses that address both immediate technical issues and longer-term climate information accessibility challenges. Table 6 Table 6. Varimax rotated factors on constraints to adaptation. 3.6 Possible strategies to adapt and mitigate the effect of climate change Table 7 presents the respondents' responses regarding adopting respective mitigation measures. The major strategies adopted by farmers include the use of organic manure (x¯ = 3.87), use of resistant crops (score x¯ = 3.85), use of drought-resistant crops (x¯ = 3.68), and use of flood-tolerant crops (x¯ = 3.73). Farmers can adopt resistant crop varieties that are better suited to withstand the impacts of climate change, such as drought, extreme temperatures, and pests. Also, afforestation (planting trees; x¯ = 3.67), and use of use of cover crops (x¯ = 3.47) are important strategies to adapt and mitigate the effect of climate change. Excerpts from the focus group discussion indicate that farmers unanimously agree that [“…Planting palm, orange, and gmelina help remove climate pollutants from the atmosphere, contribute to climate change mitigation and provide additional benefits such as soil conservation and biodiversity enhancement…”]. Furthermore, the participant indicated access to reliable weather forecasting services (x¯ = 3.86) could help farmers make informed decisions and adapt their farming practices to changing climate conditions, thereby mitigating risks associated with irregular rainfall patterns. Famers also indicated that climate-smart agriculture practices (x¯ = 3.93) are important adaptation strategies. Implementing climate-smart agricultural practices, such as conservation tillage, diversified crop rotations, and rotational grazing, could effectively mitigate climate change impacts by sequestering carbon and enhancing soil health. Table 7 Table 7. Possible strategies to adopt and mitigate the effect of climate change (n = 75). Other important strategies identified by the respondents include incorporation of residues into the soil (x¯ = 3.23), proper conservation of seeds (x¯ = 3.75), provision of adequate mulching materials (x¯ = 3.40), among others. These strategies align with the principles of climate-resilient agriculture, which aims to enhance the adaptive capacity of agricultural systems and reduce their vulnerability to climate change while contributing to climate change mitigation. Table 8 shows the Varimax rotated factors of possible strategies to adopt and mitigate the effect of climate change. Variables that had loadings of 0.4 and above being included in naming the factors. Variables that loaded in more than one factor or had loadings below 0.4 were not used. Two factors were identified and named: agronomic methods (Factor 1) and research methods (Factor 2). Under the agronomic methods (Factor 1), the major strategies identified by farmers include changing the timing of farm operations (loading = 0.777), availability of extension service delivery (loading = 0.774), incorporation of residues into the soil (loading = 0.738), provision of adequate mulching materials (loading = 0.674), provision of infrastructure (loading = 0.550), use of resistant crops (loading = 0.535), and afforestation (loading = 0.414). In Factor 2, the research methods, the strategies identified are proper conservation of seeds (loading = 0.580), provision of adequate farm input supplies (loading = 0.437), and increased investment in agricultural research and development (loading = 0.424). Table 8 Table 8. Varimax rotated factors of possible strategies to adopt and mitigate the effect of climate change. 4 Discussion 4.1 Demographic characteristics of the farmers The United Nations reports that households in three Sub-Saharan African countries have an average of over 6 members each. Senegal stands out with one of the largest household sizes in Africa, averaging 10.8 members (United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division, 2019). These significant household sizes in Sub-Saharan Africa contribute to a valuable pool of labor for agricultural activities. The substantial household sizes in sub-Saharan Africa serve as a valuable labor reservoir for agricultural activities. Mr. Ode, a rural farmer said […I cannot afford machineries hence I use local labor, often involving family and friends…]. Compared to other regions such as North America and Europe, sub-Saharan Africa has larger average household size of 6.9 (Galal, 2023; Pew Research Center, 2023). This aligns with the result of this study of a mean household size of 6.43 people, indicating the families are relatively large and can contribute as a source of labor for farming activities. Thereby giving room for farming household to spend their extra income on other adaptive expenses. The empirical evidence from Swaziland underscored that sub-Saharan African countries could bear the brunt of climate change in terms of increased incidence of poverty and economic decline, with potential impacts on household welfare (Sam et al., 2021). The decrease in agricultural production due to the effects of climate change is a key contributing factor to farmers' reduced income. Findings showed that farmers have relatively low-income, indicating their reliance on income generated from the sales of their agricultural produce. This aligns firmly with related studies from sub-Saharan Africa (Ayanlade et al., 2018; Steinert et al., 2018; Ogada et al., 2020; Nwonu et al., 2022), which indicated that farmers within the region rely on personal savings. Farming experience is crucial to building climate resilience in traditional farming systems. Findings show that farmers have an average farming experience of 21.88 years, this implies that farmers in sub-Saharan Africa possess considerable experience addressing climate change issues in their farming practices, including adaptation and mitigation strategies (Sani and Chalchisa, 2016). However, support from governments and other organizations is crucial to enhance farmers' adaptation capacity and improve their access to resources and information. 4.2 Sources of information by farmers on climate change adaptation Smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa heavily rely on the environment for their livelihoods, making climate change adaptation crucial for their resilience. To achieve this, timely information on climate change adaptation strategies is vital. Although, there is limited information on the trend in climate information sources in sub-Saharan Africa. However, a study on smallholder farmers' climate resilience in Malawi and Ghana suggests that the relevance of information sources on climate change resilience is place-specific, and some sources may impede resilience (Amoak et al., 2023). Findings from the present study showed that across various survey regions, the main avenues through which individuals access information about climate change prominently include radio broadcasts, interactions with fellow farmers, and in-person discussions with neighbors. This widespread pattern of information dissemination aligns with the findings of multiple studies conducted not only in Anambra, as highlighted by Nwabugwu et al. (2019) and Uzochukwu et al. (2021), but also in diverse sub-Saharan African contexts. One of the noteworthy aspects of this information-sharing framework is the pivotal role of radio as a powerful and accessible medium for effectively communicating climate-related knowledge to diverse target groups across the region. According to and Antwi-Agyei et al. (2021) radio has proven to be a versatile tool in disseminating climate change information to both rural and urban communities, bridging information gaps, and promoting awareness and understanding of climate-related challenges. Additionally, community radio stations have been recognized for their ability to reach huge audiences and disseminate location-specific weather reporting, making them an effective tool for sharing climate information (Harvey et al., 2019; Global Center on Adaptation, 2023). This underscores the significance of radio as a primary and trusted source of climate-related information in sub-Saharan Africa. In addition to radio, the significance of peer interactions, particularly with fellow farmers and neighboring community members, emerges as a vital information source in the present study. A study on farmers' social networks and regional spillover effects in agricultural climate change mitigation emphasizes the positive influence of peer interactions on farmers' uptake of climate change adaptation measures (Kreft et al., 2023). Furthermore, a systematic review of smallholder farmers' climate change adaptation in sub-Saharan African indicated that knowledge integration and sharing within farming communities is important for adaptation to climate change (Jellason et al., 2022). This interpersonal exchange of knowledge within farming communities fosters the sharing of practical experiences, locally relevant adaptation strategies, and mitigation measures. Farmers can learn from one another's successes and challenges, making peer interactions a crucial component of climate change education and resilience-building efforts. It is important to acknowledge that while these channels are prevalent, there are variations in their prominence and effectiveness across sub-Saharan Africa's diverse regions and cultural contexts. 4.3 Effective traditional adaptation practices farmers use to cushion the effect of climate change Traditional adaptation practices are crucial for enhancing the climate change resilience of smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa. Findings show that all the tested traditional practices have high adoption rates as farmers utilize them to mitigate and adapt to climate change to minimize its effects. This aligns with the findings of the Crace (2019), which revealed that rural farmers have developed various strategies to reduce the impact of climate change, and these strategies have been tested and proven effective, reflecting farmers' perceptions and serving as effective mitigation and adaptation strategies. The increased application of organic manure by farmers serves multiple purposes, including enhancing soil fertility sustainably and increasing soil moisture content. Farmers noted that with rising temperatures and increased evapotranspiration caused by climate change, preserving moisture for crop use is crucial, making organic manure, planting of cover crops, bush fallow and mulching preferred options. They also emphasized that organic manure is cost-effective and readily available compared to inorganic fertilizers. This aligns with the findings of Quarshie et al. (2023) that traditional agricultural practitioners in sub-Saharan Africa implement on-farm adaptation options such as water management, and soil conservation techniques to combat climate change. Results showed that farmers deployed crop rotation, mixed cropping, intercropping, integrated crop-animal irrigation practices and shifting cultivation as key traditional soil and water management practices to adapt food crop production to climate change (Olumba et al., 2020; Benhin, 2021). This aligns with the findings of Naazie et al. (2023) who found that rural farmers in Ghana use crop diversification, intercropping, mixed farming and the adoption of improved crop varieties to adapt their agricultural production to climate change. Afforestation and agroforestry are important practices for promoting sustainable land use and mitigating the effects of climate change in sub-Saharan Africa. Results from the present study showed that farmers used afforestation and agroforestry techniques as an effective adaptation strategy as opposed mitigation strategy. These offers one of the most promising technological options for reversing soil degradation, restoring tree cover, and improving agricultural productivity in Africa. Famers reported the key agroforestry practices that helped them to adapt their agricultural system to climate change to include grazing or farming under savanna trees, growing coffee or cocoa under shade trees, planting fruit trees, sowing tree seeds on fallow land to speed up the restoration of fertility, planting “living” fences, windbreaks, or woodlots, combining trees, shrubs, and field crops in multistoried cropping systems, and growing crops between rows of nitrogen-fixing trees or shrubs (“alley cropping”). On the other hand, farmers also reported their engagement in tree planting campaigns in areas where there was no forest cover previously. In sub-Saharan Africa, afforestation programs have been implemented to combat deforestation and land degradation (Chomba et al., 2020). This is an effective traditional way of increasing soil cover, sequester carbon and mitigate the effects of climate change on rural agriculture. 4.4 Possible reasons for using traditional approaches to climate change adaptation Sub-Saharan African countries are incorporating traditional approaches to climate change adaptation due to their effectiveness and relevance to local conditions. Findings indicate that adopting traditional agricultural practices for climate change adaptation delivers multi-faceted benefits including enhancing soil quality and crop productivity by altering soil structure, promoting nutrient cycling, and reducing pests and diseases. Peoples and Baldock (2020) reported that crop rotation can increase the production of subsequent crops. Niggli et al. (2019) also stated that organic matter enhances soil resistance to drought and makes them adaptable to low and high rainfall conditions. Famers reported that improving over soil health, soil organic matter and crop yield, reducing greenhouse gas emission and enhancing resilience against climate variability are the major reasons why they use traditional approaches such as use of organic manure, traditional organic composting, afforestation and agroforestry, among others. The utilization of these techniques highlights the importance of diversifying agricultural practices to enhance climate resilience, which can serve as a model for other regions grappling with similar challenges. For instance, the successful implementation of afforestation and agroforestry initiatives in Southeast Nigeria as a means of enhancing the productivity of farming business demonstrates their potential as nature-based solutions to climate change that can be scaled up in similar agro-ecosystems. As climate change continues to pose challenges to agricultural systems across the continent, sharing and scaling up these effective practices can contribute significantly to building climate-resilient farming communities and ensuring food security for future generations in sub-Saharan Africa. 4.5 Constraints to adapting traditional agriculture to climate change Smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa face multifaceted challenges as they seek to adapt traditional agriculture to climate change. Lead farmers in the present study reported that poor agricultural extension services, pest and disease vulnerability, and inadequate dissemination of climate change information due to limited extension services are factors that hinder climate change adaptation, which corroborates the research conducted by Satishkumar et al. (2020). Studies in Nigeria and Ghana have highlighted constraints such as inadequate finance, scarcity of labor, inadequate access to climate information, and lack of access to weather information as significant barriers to farmers' efforts to adapt to climate change (Abegunde et al., 2019; Ige et al., 2021). Additionally, unpredictable weather conditions have been identified as a serious constraint to climate change adaptation strategies in Northern Ghana, affecting arable crop farmers' choice of adaptation strategies (Ige et al., 2021). On the other hand, findings showed that farmers do not have the knowledge to determine the level of accuracy of their climate information, because they never had real-time access to climate information. However, Fagariba et al. (2018) suggested that the inadequacy, inaccuracy, and inconsistency of climatic information available to farmers pose constraints in weather forecasting as an adaptation strategy to climate change. Furthermore, the high cost of accessing weather forecast information and its incompatibility with farmers' needs also hampers the adoption of weather forecasting as a reliable means of coping with the effects of climate change (Ojo et al., 2018). The result of the factor analysis resolved the constraints encountered by farmers into two components namely technical production and climate information problems. This is in tandem with the findings of Autio et al. (2021) who found that smallholder farmers in Southeast Kenya face challenges in adopting climate-smart agricultural practices due to limited access to productive resources and climate uncertainty. This is probably because formal climate adaptation strategies in sub-Saharan Africa often fail to consider the agency of smallholder farmers, leading to a disconnect between the strategies and the farmers' actual adaptation practices and needs. Addressing these constraints is crucial for the successful implementation of climate-smart agricultural practices and the resilience of agricultural systems in the region. 4.6 Possible strategies to adapt and mitigate the effect of climate change in traditional agricultural systems Climate change poses significant challenges to traditional agricultural systems in sub-Saharan Africa. Smallholder farmers in the region have been adapting to a changing climate, but there is a need for more comprehensive strategies to mitigate its effects. Farmers in the study area indicated that the use of climate-smart agriculture, the use of resistant crop varieties, afforestation, and other identified strategies can effectively mitigate the effects of climate change. This finding aligns with the research conducted by Ali et al. (2019), who highlighted the importance of using resistant crop varieties to adapt and build resilience to the effects of climate change. Resistant crops are known to survive and complete their life cycles even in adverse environmental conditions, providing a useful adaptation strategy (Barasa et al., 2021). Similarly, Jellason et al. (2022) indicated that on-farm adaptation options, agro-ecological intensification (AEI) practices, diversification and intercropping, adoption of improved crop varieties and soil and water management practices are crucial adaptation strategies to climate change in sub-Saharan Africa dry lands. The results further demonstrate that farmers have developed and tested various strategies to reduce the effects of climate change. This highlights their proactive approach to adopting measures to mitigate climate change and their ability to innovate and adapt to the changing environment. The results from the factor analysis categorized the strategies adopted by farmers into two categories namely agronomic methods and research methods for adaptation. Farmers indicated that adjusting the timing of farm operations, availability of extension services, incorporating crop residues into the soil, provision of mulching materials, infrastructure, and adoption of resistant crops and afforestation, are vital agronomic strategies to adapt traditional agriculture to climate change. In terms of the research methods to adaptations, farmers highlight the importance of proper seed conservation, availability of adequate farm inputs, and increased investment in agricultural research and development as crucial aspects to address in enhancing the resilience of their agricultural systems to climate change. 5 Conclusion This study provides valuable insights into the socioeconomic characteristics of farmers and their practices in adapting to climate change. The findings highlight the significant role of women in rural areas and their involvement in sustainable agriculture practices, as evidenced by a higher percentage of female respondents. The large household size and relatively low-income levels underscore the importance of agriculture as a primary source of livelihood for these farmers. Farmers have considerable experience addressing climate change issues, indicating their potential to collaborate and implement effective adaptation and mitigation strategies. However, the study also reveals the reliance on limited sources of climate change information, such as radio and fellow farmers, indicating the need for improved dissemination channels and access to diverse sources of knowledge. The study highlights the prevalent use of climate-smart traditional agricultural practices among indigenous people, including organic manure application and mixed farming, demonstrating farmers' proactive approach to mitigating the effects of climate change. These practices enhance soil fertility and moisture retention and improve crop productivity and resilience. Nevertheless, the study identifies constraints such as poor extension services, limited access to climate information, and technical challenges that hinder effective adaptation. These constraints require enhanced support systems, policy interventions, and agricultural research and development investments. In light of the findings, promoting climate-smart agriculture, the use of resistant crop varieties, afforestation, and sustainable farming practices emerge as essential strategies to mitigate the effects of climate change. By addressing the identified constraints and building upon farmers' existing knowledge and experiences, we can enhance their resilience, improve agricultural productivity, and contribute to sustainable rural development. 5.1 Policy implications of the findings • Strengthen extension services and diversify information sources: Governments should invest in and strengthen extension services to provide farmers with up-to-date climate change information, area-specific weather cues, agricultural best practices, and new technologies. And promote the use of diverse information sources, including indigenous channels, digital platforms and community-based knowledge sharing. • Promote climate-smart agricultural practices: Encourage the adoption of climate-smart agricultural practices through incentives, subsidies, and training programs. Governments should support research and development in climate-resilient crop varieties and livestock breeds. • Increase investment in agricultural research: Allocate more funding to agricultural research and innovation to develop climate-resilient technologies, improved crop varieties, and sustainable farming practices. • Access to credit for climate-resilient infrastructure: Facilitate access to credit and financial services for farmers to invest in climate-resilient infrastructure, such as irrigation systems, drought-resistant seeds, and storage facilities. • Supportive policies and collaborative networks: Create a conducive policy environment that encourages sustainable agricultural practices and promotes collaboration among various stakeholders, including government agencies, NGOs, and research institutions. • Capacity-Building Workshops and Progress Monitoring: Organize capacity-building workshops and training programs for farmers, extension workers, and other stakeholders to enhance their knowledge and skills in climate adaptation and mitigation. And also implement regular progress monitoring and evaluation to assess the effectiveness of climate adaptation efforts. • Enabling Environment for Continuous Learning and Improvement: Foster an environment that promotes continuous learning and improvement in agricultural practices.

Adaptation strategies of traditional agriculture to climate change in sub-Saharan Africa David John Okoronkwo1Remigius Ikechukwu Ozioko2Rachael Ujunwa Ugwoke2Uzoh Victor Nwagbo2*Cynthia Nwobodo2Chidiebere Happiness Ugwu2Gozie Godswill Okoro2Esther C. Mbah3 1Department of Sustainability in Agriculture, Food Production and Food Technology, Hungarian University of Agricultural and Life Sciences, Godollo, Hungary 2Department of Agricultural Extension, University of Nigeria, Nsukka, Nigeria 3Department of Animal Science, University of Nigeria, Nsukka, Nigeria Introduction: Sub-Saharan Africa faces increasingly unpredictable and extreme weather patterns due to climate change, posing significant threats to food security and rural livelihoods. Traditional agriculture, deeply rooted in the region's history and culture, is particularly vulnerable to these changes. This study investigates the adaptation strategies of traditional agricultural farmers to climate change using southeast Nigeria as a microcosm of the broader challenges facing sub-Saharan Africa. Methods: Multistage sampling procedure was used to select 75 farmer group leaders in the study region. Cross-sectional data were collected through semi-structured interview schedules and focus group discussions. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and principal component analysis using Varimax rotated matrix. Results: Findings showed that farmers rely on face-to-face discussions with neighbors (76.0%), fellow farmers (66.7%), and radio (54.7%) as their primary sources of information on climate change. Results showed that traditional adaptation practices such as use of organic manure (x¯ = 3.89), traditional organic composting (x¯ = 3.80), afforestation (x¯ = 3.71), agroforestry (x¯ = 3.61) were the topmost traditional agricultural practices use to cushion the effect of climate change. Conserving the overall soil health, soil moisture retention, reducing CO2 emissions and maintaining crop productivity were the major reasons for using the traditional approaches. Climate-induced drought and high cost of accessing weather information (x¯ = 1.93), and inadequate funding (x¯ = 1.92), among others were the key constraints to adaptation. Discussion: Results showed that farmers prioritize agronomic manipulation and integrated research approaches as key strategies to adapting traditional agriculture to climate anomalies. Although farmers used their indigenous practices, continuous learning and improvement through capacity-building workshops and progress monitoring are essential for effective climate change adaptation. Policymakers should invest in promoting indigenous knowledge, provide access to credit for climate-resilient infrastructure, promote climate-smart agricultural practices and foster collaborative research as the cornerstone for sustainable rural development. 1 Introduction Sub-Saharan Africa, a vast and diverse region characterized by its rich cultural heritage and ecological variety, has long been recognized as a crucial battleground in the fight against climate change and its devastating consequences (Thompson et al., 2010). The region is particularly vulnerable to climate change, with multiple biophysical, political, and socioeconomic stresses interacting to affect rural communities, where agriculture is a major lifeline. Studies consistently predict decreased crop productivity, land degradation, high market prices, and negative impacts on livelihoods, exacerbating food insecurity in the region (Emediegwu et al., 2022; Oyelami et al., 2023). Climate change is intensifying food insecurity across sub-Saharan Africa, and leading to changes in yield and area growth, higher food prices, reduced calorie availability, and growing childhood malnutrition (Ringler et al., 2010). Salgado Baptista et al. (2022) projected the crop yield, especially in key staples, in the region to decline by 5–17% by 2050 due to rising temperatures and rainfall volatility. Successive weather shocks, such as droughts and floods, significantly raise food insecurity, particularly in countries where agricultural productivity is already below the global average (Salgado Baptista et al., 2022). With a predominantly agrarian economy dominated by stallholder farmers and a heavy reliance on traditional agricultural practices rooted in centuries of local knowledge and practices, the nations of sub-Saharan Africa are acutely vulnerable to the adverse impacts of a changing climate. Nigeria, as the most populous country in Africa, serves as a microcosm of the broader challenges and opportunities facing sub-Saharan Africa. It plays a pivotal role in the region's agricultural landscape and is emblematic of the broader climate adaptation issues faced by many nations in sub-Saharan Africa. Nigeria is estimated to contribute 14% of Africa's agriculture GDP, making it one of the top three African countries with the highest GDP contribution from agriculture (Oyaniran and Omomia, 2018). Between January and March 2021, agriculture contributed to 22.35% of Nigeria's GDP, with over 140 million Nigerians engaged in the sector mainly at a subsistence level. On formal level, more than 36% (above 28.9 million) of Nigeria's labor force was employed in agriculture, with over 80% of the agricultural workforce being smallholder farmers (FAO, 2019; Mayong et al., 2021; International Trade Administration, 2023). Nigeria possesses an abundance of arable land and a favorable climate to produce various crops, including maize, cassava, guinea corn, yam, beans, millet, and rice (FAO, 2019). However, despite its significant contribution to the economy, Nigeria's agricultural sector faces formidable challenges such as climate change and climate-induced socio-economic stressors. These challenges have stifled agricultural productivity, affecting the sector's contribution to the country's GDP and leading to increased food imports due to population growth (FAO, 2019). The impacts of climate change in Nigeria are characterized by increasing climate variability, leading to more intense and untimely rainfall, land degradation, flash floods, landslides, and gully erosion (Ghosh, 2019; World Bank, 2022). By 2009, an estimated 6,000 gullies were destroying infrastructure, farmland, and real estate across rural and urban Nigeria, causing fear and despair among the population (World Bank, 2022). The climate change-induced losses and unsustainable use of resources have elevated themselves to a real development challenge in Nigeria, particularly along the coastal states in the south and the northern frontline states, thwarting the age-old rhythms of traditional agriculture which are rooted in centuries of local knowledge and practices. The negative impacts of climate change on Nigeria's agriculture have been observed predominantly in the northern, northeastern, southwestern and southeast regions, which experience extreme weather conditions (Tajudeen et al., 2022; World Bank, 2022). The loss of life and property due to sudden, unpredictable, and uncontrollable floods is a nightmare for many Nigerians, destroying crops, farms, lands, and houses. The agricultural sector, which is the country's economic mainstay, is also grappling with lower crop yields, food insecurity, deepening poverty, forced displacement, labor inefficiency due to high temperatures and conflicts due to drought, flooding, sea level rise, erosion, and rapid decline in earth's limiting resources (Brouziyne et al., 2018; Obaji et al., 2022; United Nations Development Programme, 2023). In 2022 alone, climate-induced pests and diseases insurgence caused crop losses of up to 80% in some areas, impacting 1.5–200,000 hectares of land, and more than 20% of crops experienced post-harvest losses in several states (Adegwu, 2022). Major crops affected included maize, rice, sorghum, millet, soybean, groundnut, cowpea, root and tubers, fruits, vegetables, and tree crops in 33 states (Adegwu, 2022; Rizzo et al., 2023). The country's tropical climate is characterized by high temperatures, humidity, and rainfall, with larger amounts of rainfall experienced in the south and southeast regions of the country. Wind patterns are influenced by Nigeria's location and topography, largely due to the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) which brings moist winds from the Atlantic Ocean during the wet season and dry winds from the Sahara Desert during the dry season (Dia et al., 2023), which influences the annual temperature. The Nigeria temperature records indicate an average increase of 1.4–1.9°C, with predictions of further increases of 2–5°C by the end of the century if no decisive action is taken (Brouziyne et al., 2018). Nigeria is already experiencing the adverse effects of climate change, as with natural disasters are occurring more frequently and with greater intensity. These multi-dimensional adverse effects have not only hampered the ability of the agricultural sector to meet the country's food demands but have also disrupted the traditional roles of agriculture in Nigeria's economy, leading to a shift from being a net food exporter to an importer (Onyeneke et al., 2021). The cumulative agricultural imports of the country stood at N3.35 trillion between 2016 and 2019, which was four times higher than the agricultural export of N803 billion within the same period (FAO, 2019). Therefore, it is crucial to explore and implement interdisciplinary adaptation strategies that can enhance the sustainability and resilience of agri-food systems to climate anomalies. Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) has emerged as a competent response to the challenges posed by climate change on agriculture in rural areas. It entails the integration of traditional agricultural practices with modern techniques. Traditional agriculture, rooted in indigenous knowledge, cultural beliefs, and sustainable practices, offers valuable insights into adapting agricultural systems to a changing climate (Tsado, 2019). The approach of CSA is recognized for its potential to enhance farm productivity and incomes, adaptation, and resilience to climate change in rural African context (Abegunde and Obi, 2022). CSA offers a comprehensive strategy for addressing the interconnected challenges faced by smallholder farmers in African countries, focusing on three core goals: increasing agricultural productivity, adapting and building resilience to climate change, and developing opportunities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture (Obaji et al., 2022). Additionally, the FAO emphasizes that CSA is an approach that helps guide actions to transform agri-food systems toward green and climate-resilient practices, addressing challenges related to climate change and agriculture (FAO, 2023). However, CSA is not a one-size-fits-all approach and requires tailoring to specific climate risks faced by different farming communities, regions, and ecosystems. While CSA offers a solution to many of the secondary and tertiary problems caused by climate shocks, it is still not a familiar solution to climate adaptation and mitigation in last-mile communities. The effective utilization of CSA at grassroots is not just about understanding “how its works” but in appreciating the intricate web of cultural, economic, ecological, and technological factors that influence this adaptation tactics. Rural communities in sub-Saharan Africa are adapting their traditional agriculture to climate change through a variety of strategies and practices. Indigenous peoples and local communities are leveraging traditional knowledge and improved crop varieties to cope with extreme weather and environmental changes caused by climate change (Swiderska, 2011). Traditional agricultural practices, which have been developed over centuries, are proving to be valuable in building resilience and adapting to the impacts of climate change (Singh and Singh, 2017). Adjustments in planting dates, crop varieties, drainage systems, using advanced technologies and land management regimes to maintain yields and soil fertility (Arbuckle et al., 2015), are crucial on-the-ground strategies used by local farmers to counter the adverse effects of climatic changes. Traditional practices, such as agroforestry, intercropping, crop rotation, cover cropping, traditional organic composting, and integrated crop-animal farming, have demonstrated the potential to improve crop productivity and mitigate climate change impacts (Tripathi et al., 2019; Mashi et al., 2022). These practices, honed over thousands of years by indigenous farmers and local communities, provide valuable adaptation strategies in the face of climate uncertainties. Traditional agricultural practices have the potential to adapt and mitigate climate change through its unique agroecological features. They increase agrobiodiversity and resilience of agroecosystems, are low-cost, energy-efficient, and based on locally available resources (Singh and Singh, 2017). It is characterized by high productivity, biodiversity conservation, low energy inputs, and climate change mitigation (Singh and Singh, 2017). Therefore, integrating traditional knowledge into climate change policies is seen as a cost-effective, climate-smart approach and sustainable adaptation strategy to climate variability. While there is a growing recognition of the role of traditional knowledge in adapting agriculture to climate change, the role of indigenous knowledge and adaptive practices remains largely undervalued by decision-makers. Negotiating parties in international climate talks tend to focus on intensifying production through modern agriculture, overlooking the potential of traditional knowledge in adaptation (Swiderska, 2011). The unsustainable transition from traditional agriculture to modern methods in rural communities has led to the loss of crop genetic resources and environmental sustainability challenges, exacerbating the effects of climate change. Therefore, there is an urgent need to rediscover and re-implement traditional agricultural practices while integrating them with modern approaches to enhance the socio-ecological integrity of agroecosystems (Shittu et al., 2021). Ricart et al. (2023) analyzed a portfolio of 435 articles collected from WoS and Scopus databases between 2010 and 2020, finding that farmers are in a favorable position to offer first-hand observations and provide a deeper understanding of climate change manifestation, relevance, effects, and narratives. Therefore, farmers' knowledge provides a framework for appraising and incorporating new ideas, experiences, and information into existing systems (Haradhan, 2017). This study explored the adaptation strategies employed by farmers to mitigate the impacts of climate change on their indigenous agricultural system using southeast Nigeria as a model region for all riparian regions in sub-Saharan Africa. The specific objective of the study entails identifying the key climate change information sources by farmers; elicit the effective traditional adaptation practices farmers use to cushion the effect of climate change; examine the possible reasons for using traditional approaches to climate change adaptation, identify the constraints to adaptation, and the effective strategies to adapt and mitigate the effect of climate change. The grand objective of the study is to provide grassroots insights and recommendations for fostering sustainability and climate-resilient agri-food systems in sub-Saharan Africa. 2 Methodology The study was carried out in Southeast Nigeria, specifically within the geographical coordinates of latitudes 04° 17′N and 07° 06′N and longitudes 05° 23′E and 09° 28′E, as described in Macmillian's 2009 report. This region covers an area spanning 29,908 square kilometers and is inhabited by ~16,381,729 people, according to the Nigeria. National Bureau of Statistics (2007). It encompasses the territories of Abia state, Anambra state, Ebonyi state, Enugu state, and Imo state (see Figure 1). The climate of the Southeast can be broadly characterized as tropical, featuring distinct wet and dry seasons. It falls within the tropical belt, with early rainfall typically occurring in January/February and the full onset of the rainy season in March, concluding in November each year. The dry season typically lasts for 4–5 months, with the highest rainfall occurring from July to October, with a slight respite in August. On average, the region experiences an annual rainfall of ~1,952 mm, and the mean daily and annual temperatures are around 28 and 27°C, respectively (Igbokwe et al., 2008). Southeast Nigeria is primarily an agricultural area, with predominantly sandy and often loose and porous soil types. The most commonly cultivated crops in this region include cassava, rice, yam, cocoyam, maize, plantain/banana, cashew, oil palm, and coconut. Additionally, the major livestock raised in the area consist of goats, sheep, and poultry. In the southeastern region, the effects of climate change are readily noticeable, manifested in increased instances of flooding, landslides, and erosion, which have resulted in the loss of lives, homes, farmlands, properties, and roads, among other adverse consequences (Agwu and Okhimamhe, 2009). Figure 1 Figure 1. Map of southeast Nigeria. Source: Macmillian Atlas Series 2009. The population for the study comprised all farmers and relevant stakeholders operating in difficult-to-reach communities in the study region. Respondents were selected using a multi-stage sampling procedure. In the first stage, the five states that make up the Southeast Nigeria were selected purposefully to have good spread and depth of data and local perspectives. In the second stage, three senatorial zones were randomly selected in each state, given a total of 15 senatorial zones. In the third stage, five representative lead-farmers each were randomly selected from each of the 15 senatorial zones, given a total of 75 farmers used for the study. Data were collected using a semi-structure interview schedule and focus group discussion based on the specific objectives. The reliability of the instrument was tested using the Cronbach Alpha coefficient for internal consistency. The instrument was validated by experts in the Department of Agricultural Extension, University of Nigeria, Nsukka. Personal data, such as age (in years), gender (male or female), marital status (single, married, divorced/separated, and widowed), education (number of years spent in school), farming experience (years), household size (number of persons currently in the household), household monthly income (naira), estimated annual earnings (naira), access to extension service (number of times in the past 1 year), membership to the social organization(s), and access to credit facilities, were collected. Sources of information on climate change were collected by asking respondents to tick “Yes” or “No” from a list of information sources. Data on the effective traditional adaptation practices used to cushion the effects of climate change were collected by providing a list of perceived traditional practices. Respondents were required to rate the effective adaptive practices on a four-point Likert-type scale of very effective (4), effective (3), a little effective (2) and not effective (1). A mean score (2.5) was obtained. Variables with a mean score ≥2.5 were regarded as effective practices. Information on possible reasons for using traditional approaches for climate change adaptation were obtained by providing a list of variables for the respondents. Respondents were asked to rank the importance of traditional practices to their climate adaptation from a list of practices on a 3-point Likert scale of very important (3), important (2) and not important (1). A mean score (2) was obtained and all the variables with mean score ≥2 were regarded as important to adaptive capacity. Data on constraints to adaptation and mitigation were collected by asking the respondents to rank their constraints on a 3-point Likert scale of major constraint (2), minor constraint (1), not a constraint (0)—with a mean score of one. Data on the effectiveness of the strategies to mitigate the effect of climate change was measured by asking respondents to choose from a list of variables provided. Their responses were captured on a four-point Likert-type scale of very effective (4), effective (3), little effective (2), and not effective (1). A mean score (2.5) was obtained. Responses with a mean score ≥2.5 were regarded as effective. Excerpts from semi structure interviews and focus group discussions were reported in the result section of the article. Data obtained were analyzed with descriptive statistics (percentages, mean, and standard deviation) and principal component analysis using Varimax rotated factors analysis—through the IBM SPSS Statistics version 21 software. 3 Results 3.1 Socioeconomic characteristics of the farmers According to Table 1, results reveal that 52.0% of the respondents were female, while 48.0% were male. Regarding age distribution, most respondents (28.0%) fell within the 31–40 age range. Approximately 24.0% were aged between 41 and 50, 20.0% were 60 and above, and 18.7% were 30 and below. Only 9.3% were between 51 and 60 years old. The mean age of the farmers was 46.11, suggesting the active participation of middle-aged individuals in traditional agriculture. Regarding household size, a significant proportion (72.0%) of respondents had a household size of 5–8 persons, while 12.0% had 1–4 persons, and 16.0% had 8 or more persons. The results also indicate that the mean monthly household income was ₦20,093.33. Table 1 Table 1. Socioeconomic characteristics of the respondents (n = 75). 3.2 Sources of information by farmers on climate change adaptation The results in Table 2 indicate that most (76.0%) respondents obtain information on climate change, adaptation, and mitigation through face-to-face discussions with neighbors. This implies that community-based community approaches could be highly effective in disseminating information about climate change. Leveraging indigenous communication channels such as implementing community meetings or local discussion groups could be a strategic way to spread awareness and knowledge on climate adaptation and mitigation measures. Additionally, 66.7% of the respondents acquired information from fellow farmers. This implies that farmers probably trust and value the experiences and knowledge of their peers. Programs that engage local farmers as educators or facilitators could leverage this trust and peer influence for effective communication on climate resilience building. The reliance on radio by more than half 54.7% of respondents highlights its importance as a traditional but still relevant medium, especially in areas where digital connectivity might be limited. Radio programs focused on climate change, featuring expert advice, success stories from other farmers, and practical tips for adaptation and mitigation, could be a very effective outreach tool. Other information sources include videos (29.3%), newsletters on climate change (22.7%), internet (21.3%), television (20.0%), and among others. The variety of climate change information sources used by farmers underscores the need for a multi-channel communication strategy—since informal channels (neighbors and fellow farmers) could brood risk of misinformation or incomplete information being circulated. Table 2 Table 2. Source of information of farmers on climate changes (n = 75). 3.3 Effective traditional adaptation practices farmers use to cushion the effect of climate change In Table 3 show the traditional adaptation practices farmers use to cushion the effect of climate change. The traditional adaptation practices used include use of organic manure (x¯ = 3.89), traditional organic composting (x¯ = 3.80), afforestation (x¯ = 3.71), agroforestry (x¯ = 3.61), crop rotation (x¯ = 3.40), and mulching (x¯ = 3.37). These practices not only help in adapting to climate change but also contribute to mitigating its effects by enhancing carbon sequestration and biodiversity. For instance, the use of organic manure by the study participants is due to their accessibility, cost-effectiveness, or perceived effectiveness in improving soil health and resilience against climate variability. Excerpts from the focus group discussion indicate that farmers unanimously agree that [“…they use organic manure due to their accessibility, cost-effectiveness, or perceived effectiveness in improving soil health and resilience against climate variability…”]. Hence, these practices indicate a level of knowledge and adaptation to local climatic conditions. Table 3 Table 3. Traditional adaptation practices farmers use to cushion the effect of climate change (n = 75). Other traditional adaptation practices include intercropping (x¯ = 3.36), planting of cover crops and irrigation (x¯ = 3.29), integrated crop-animal farming (x¯ = 3.21), bush fallow practices (x¯ = 3.13), and among others. The use of intercropping and integrated crop-animal farming implies that indigenous people and communities prioritizes diversification as a key risk management strategy against the backdrop of climate change. Additionally, the use of irrigation, bush fallowing and covering crops indicates an awareness of and response to the need for optimal resource utilization, maintenance of soil health and sustainability, which is crucial for long-term agricultural productivity in the face of climate change. 3.4 Possible reasons for using traditional approaches to climate change adaptation Table 4 presents the key reasons for using traditional approaches to climate change adaptation. The reasons identified include increased soil fertility (x¯ = 2.95), aeration of soil (x¯ = 2.85), reduction of soil erosion (x¯ = 2.73), increase in soil moisture (x¯ = 2.03), enhancement of soil structure and aggregation (x¯ = 2.79), promotion of mineralization of nitrogen-containing compounds in the soil through the use of leguminous crops (x¯ = 2.68), reduction of nutrient loss from the soil (x¯ = 2.73), reduction of chemical pollution in the soil (x¯ = 2.33), and enhancement of agro-biodiversity through intercropping of legumes (x¯ = 2.56). This implies that farmers are aware of the importance of soil health in sustainable farming and climate change adaptation. This reflects a desire to maintain sustainable, eco-friendly farming practices that not only benefit the current crop but also contribute to the long-term health of the farm ecosystem. The reliance on traditional methods to deliver these benefits indicates a strong base of traditional agricultural knowledge and practices well-suited to local environmental conditions that have been passed down through generations. While these traditional practices are beneficial, there is potential for enhancing their effectiveness through the integration of scientific research and modern agricultural techniques. Table 4 Table 4. Possible reasons for using traditional approaches to climate change adaptation. 3.5 Constraints to adapting traditional agriculture to climate change Table 5 presents the constraints identified by the respondents to the use of traditional adaptation strategies. The major constraints to adaptation include climate variation leading to drought and high cost of accessing weather information (x¯ = 1.93), and inadequate funding (x¯ = 1.92). Access to micro-climate cues and finances are crucial in building local adaptation strategies. High cost of accessing reliable weather information frustrates traditional adaptive measures, making it difficult for farmers to plan and make informed climate-smart decisions effectively. It is therefore imperative to provide a more accessible, affordable, and accurate weather forecasting services tailored for farmers alongside financial assistance programs, subsidies, or microfinance solutions targeted at smallholder farmers. Participants also indicated that lack of technical knowledge and know-how (x¯ = 1.89) pose a major challenge to adapt. Mrs. Ngozika, a rural farmer from the study participant stated thus [“…I do not know the practical steps I could take to improve my farm activities in this era of climate change…”]. This implies a gap in the knowledge and skills necessary to implement effective adaptation strategies, which could probably be due to inadequate extension services or training programs. Inadequate infrastructure (x¯ = 1.87), such as roads and storage facilities, limits the ability of farmers to adapt to and mitigate the impacts of climate change. There is a need for governmental and non-governmental bodies to invest in rural infrastructure to support agricultural activities. Also, inadequate access to climate change information (x¯ = 1.85) present a formidable obstacle to rural adaptive capacities. This aligns with the high cost of accessing weather information and highlights a broader issue of information accessibility. Vulnerability to pests and diseases (x¯ = 1.83) resulting from climate change bedevils farmers adaptation efforts. Therefore, research into and promotion of climate-resilient crop varieties and integrated pest management practices are crucial for traditional agricultural systems. Other constraints faced by farmers include inadequate credit facilities (x¯ = 1.79), poor agricultural program and service delivery (x¯ = 1.69), high economic losses from farming (x¯ = 1.65), among others. Table 5 Table 5. Constraints to adaptation. Table 6 presents the results of the factor analysis of the constraints to adaptation. The variables with a loading of 0.4 score and above were included in naming the factors. Variables that loaded in more than one factor or had loadings below 0.4 were not used. Two key factors were identified and named: a technical problem (Factor 1) and a climate information problem (Factor 2). Under the technical problem (Factor 1), the major constraints identified by farmers include poor agricultural program and service delivery (loading = 0.768), high cost of farm operations (loading = 0.663), lack of skilled laboratory facilities for farm practices (loading = 0.650), inconsistent government policies (loading = 0.580), lack of extension services for providing information to farmers (loading = 0.539), high economic losses from farming (loading = 0.500), and vulnerability to pests and diseases (loading = 0.487). In Factor 2, the climate informational problem includes the high cost of accessing weather information (loading = 0.692) and drought climate variation (loading = 0.515). The factor analysis provides a clear framework for understanding the complex array of challenges in agricultural adaptation, emphasizing the need for comprehensive, well-coordinated responses that address both immediate technical issues and longer-term climate information accessibility challenges.

Varimax rotated factors on constraints to adaptation. 3.6 Possible strategies to adapt and mitigate the effect of climate change Table 7 presents the respondents' responses regarding adopting respective mitigation measures. The major strategies adopted by farmers include the use of organic manure (x¯ = 3.87), use of resistant crops (score x¯ = 3.85), use of drought-resistant crops (x¯ = 3.68), and use of flood-tolerant crops (x¯ = 3.73). Farmers can adopt resistant crop varieties that are better suited to withstand the impacts of climate change, such as drought, extreme temperatures, and pests. Also, afforestation (planting trees; x¯ = 3.67), and use of use of cover crops (x¯ = 3.47) are important strategies to adapt and mitigate the effect of climate change. Excerpts from the focus group discussion indicate that farmers unanimously agree that [“…Planting palm, orange, and gmelina help remove climate pollutants from the atmosphere, contribute to climate change mitigation and provide additional benefits such as soil conservation and biodiversity enhancement…”]. Furthermore, the participant indicated access to reliable weather forecasting services (x¯ = 3.86) could help farmers make informed decisions and adapt their farming practices to changing climate conditions, thereby mitigating risks associated with irregular rainfall patterns. Famers also indicated that climate-smart agriculture practices (x¯ = 3.93) are important adaptation strategies. Implementing climate-smart agricultural practices, such as conservation tillage, diversified crop rotations, and rotational grazing, could effectively mitigate climate change impacts by sequestering carbon and enhancing soil health. Table 7 Table 7. Possible strategies to adopt and mitigate the effect of climate change (n = 75). Other important strategies identified by the respondents include incorporation of residues into the soil (x¯ = 3.23), proper conservation of seeds (x¯ = 3.75), provision of adequate mulching materials (x¯ = 3.40), among others. These strategies align with the principles of climate-resilient agriculture, which aims to enhance the adaptive capacity of agricultural systems and reduce their vulnerability to climate change while contributing to climate change mitigation. Table 8 shows the Varimax rotated factors of possible strategies to adopt and mitigate the effect of climate change. Variables that had loadings of 0.4 and above being included in naming the factors. Variables that loaded in more than one factor or had loadings below 0.4 were not used. Two factors were identified and named: agronomic methods (Factor 1) and research methods (Factor 2). Under the agronomic methods (Factor 1), the major strategies identified by farmers include changing the timing of farm operations (loading = 0.777), availability of extension service delivery (loading = 0.774), incorporation of residues into the soil (loading = 0.738), provision of adequate mulching materials (loading = 0.674), provision of infrastructure (loading = 0.550), use of resistant crops (loading = 0.535), and afforestation (loading = 0.414). In Factor 2, the research methods, the strategies identified are proper conservation of seeds (loading = 0.580), provision of adequate farm input supplies (loading = 0.437), and increased investment in agricultural research and development (loading = 0.424). Table 8 Table 8. Varimax rotated factors of possible strategies to adopt and mitigate the effect of climate change. 4 Discussion 4.1 Demographic characteristics of the farmers The United Nations reports that households in three Sub-Saharan African countries have an average of over 6 members each. Senegal stands out with one of the largest household sizes in Africa, averaging 10.8 members (United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division, 2019). These significant household sizes in Sub-Saharan Africa contribute to a valuable pool of labor for agricultural activities. The substantial household sizes in sub-Saharan Africa serve as a valuable labor reservoir for agricultural activities. Mr. Ode, a rural farmer said […I cannot afford machineries hence I use local labor, often involving family and friends…]. Compared to other regions such as North America and Europe, sub-Saharan Africa has larger average household size of 6.9 (Galal, 2023; Pew Research Center, 2023). This aligns with the result of this study of a mean household size of 6.43 people, indicating the families are relatively large and can contribute as a source of labor for farming activities. Thereby giving room for farming household to spend their extra income on other adaptive expenses. The empirical evidence from Swaziland underscored that sub-Saharan African countries could bear the brunt of climate change in terms of increased incidence of poverty and economic decline, with potential impacts on household welfare (Sam et al., 2021). The decrease in agricultural production due to the effects of climate change is a key contributing factor to farmers' reduced income. Findings showed that farmers have relatively low-income, indicating their reliance on income generated from the sales of their agricultural produce. This aligns firmly with related studies from sub-Saharan Africa (Ayanlade et al., 2018; Steinert et al., 2018; Ogada et al., 2020; Nwonu et al., 2022), which indicated that farmers within the region rely on personal savings. Farming experience is crucial to building climate resilience in traditional farming systems. Findings show that farmers have an average farming experience of 21.88 years, this implies that farmers in sub-Saharan Africa possess considerable experience addressing climate change issues in their farming practices, including adaptation and mitigation strategies (Sani and Chalchisa, 2016). However, support from governments and other organizations is crucial to enhance farmers' adaptation capacity and improve their access to resources and information. 4.2 Sources of information by farmers on climate change adaptation Smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa heavily rely on the environment for their livelihoods, making climate change adaptation crucial for their resilience. To achieve this, timely information on climate change adaptation strategies is vital. Although, there is limited information on the trend in climate information sources in sub-Saharan Africa. However, a study on smallholder farmers' climate resilience in Malawi and Ghana suggests that the relevance of information sources on climate change resilience is place-specific, and some sources may impede resilience (Amoak et al., 2023). Findings from the present study showed that across various survey regions, the main avenues through which individuals access information about climate change prominently include radio broadcasts, interactions with fellow farmers, and in-person discussions with neighbors. This widespread pattern of information dissemination aligns with the findings of multiple studies conducted not only in Anambra, as highlighted by Nwabugwu et al. (2019) and Uzochukwu et al. (2021), but also in diverse sub-Saharan African contexts. One of the noteworthy aspects of this information-sharing framework is the pivotal role of radio as a powerful and accessible medium for effectively communicating climate-related knowledge to diverse target groups across the region. According to and Antwi-Agyei et al. (2021) radio has proven to be a versatile tool in disseminating climate change information to both rural and urban communities, bridging information gaps, and promoting awareness and understanding of climate-related challenges. Additionally, community radio stations have been recognized for their ability to reach huge audiences and disseminate location-specific weather reporting, making them an effective tool for sharing climate information (Harvey et al., 2019; Global Center on Adaptation, 2023). This underscores the significance of radio as a primary and trusted source of climate-related information in sub-Saharan Africa. In addition to radio, the significance of peer interactions, particularly with fellow farmers and neighboring community members, emerges as a vital information source in the present study. A study on farmers' social networks and regional spillover effects in agricultural climate change mitigation emphasizes the positive influence of peer interactions on farmers' uptake of climate change adaptation measures (Kreft et al., 2023). Furthermore, a systematic review of smallholder farmers' climate change adaptation in sub-Saharan African indicated that knowledge integration and sharing within farming communities is important for adaptation to climate change (Jellason et al., 2022). This interpersonal exchange of knowledge within farming communities fosters the sharing of practical experiences, locally relevant adaptation strategies, and mitigation measures. Farmers can learn from one another's successes and challenges, making peer interactions a crucial component of climate change education and resilience-building efforts. It is important to acknowledge that while these channels are prevalent, there are variations in their prominence and effectiveness across sub-Saharan Africa's diverse regions and cultural contexts. 4.3 Effective traditional adaptation practices farmers use to cushion the effect of climate change Traditional adaptation practices are crucial for enhancing the climate change resilience of smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa. Findings show that all the tested traditional practices have high adoption rates as farmers utilize them to mitigate and adapt to climate change to minimize its effects. This aligns with the findings of the Crace (2019), which revealed that rural farmers have developed various strategies to reduce the impact of climate change, and these strategies have been tested and proven effective, reflecting farmers' perceptions and serving as effective mitigation and adaptation strategies. The increased application of organic manure by farmers serves multiple purposes, including enhancing soil fertility sustainably and increasing soil moisture content. Farmers noted that with rising temperatures and increased evapotranspiration caused by climate change, preserving moisture for crop use is crucial, making organic manure, planting of cover crops, bush fallow and mulching preferred options. They also emphasized that organic manure is cost-effective and readily available compared to inorganic fertilizers. This aligns with the findings of Quarshie et al. (2023) that traditional agricultural practitioners in sub-Saharan Africa implement on-farm adaptation options such as water management, and soil conservation techniques to combat climate change. Results showed that farmers deployed crop rotation, mixed cropping, intercropping, integrated crop-animal irrigation practices and shifting cultivation as key traditional soil and water management practices to adapt food crop production to climate change (Olumba et al., 2020; Benhin, 2021). This aligns with the findings of Naazie et al. (2023) who found that rural farmers in Ghana use crop diversification, intercropping, mixed farming and the adoption of improved crop varieties to adapt their agricultural production to climate change. Afforestation and agroforestry are important practices for promoting sustainable land use and mitigating the effects of climate change in sub-Saharan Africa. Results from the present study showed that farmers used afforestation and agroforestry techniques as an effective adaptation strategy as opposed mitigation strategy. These offers one of the most promising technological options for reversing soil degradation, restoring tree cover, and improving agricultural productivity in Africa. Famers reported the key agroforestry practices that helped them to adapt their agricultural system to climate change to include grazing or farming under savanna trees, growing coffee or cocoa under shade trees, planting fruit trees, sowing tree seeds on fallow land to speed up the restoration of fertility, planting “living” fences, windbreaks, or woodlots, combining trees, shrubs, and field crops in multistoried cropping systems, and growing crops between rows of nitrogen-fixing trees or shrubs (“alley cropping”). On the other hand, farmers also reported their engagement in tree planting campaigns in areas where there was no forest cover previously. In sub-Saharan Africa, afforestation programs have been implemented to combat deforestation and land degradation (Chomba et al., 2020). This is an effective traditional way of increasing soil cover, sequester carbon and mitigate the effects of climate change on rural agriculture. 4.4 Possible reasons for using traditional approaches to climate change adaptation Sub-Saharan African countries are incorporating traditional approaches to climate change adaptation due to their effectiveness and relevance to local conditions. Findings indicate that adopting traditional agricultural practices for climate change adaptation delivers multi-faceted benefits including enhancing soil quality and crop productivity by altering soil structure, promoting nutrient cycling, and reducing pests and diseases. Peoples and Baldock (2020) reported that crop rotation can increase the production of subsequent crops. Niggli et al. (2019) also stated that organic matter enhances soil resistance to drought and makes them adaptable to low and high rainfall conditions. Famers reported that improving over soil health, soil organic matter and crop yield, reducing greenhouse gas emission and enhancing resilience against climate variability are the major reasons why they use traditional approaches such as use of organic manure, traditional organic composting, afforestation and agroforestry, among others. The utilization of these techniques highlights the importance of diversifying agricultural practices to enhance climate resilience, which can serve as a model for other regions grappling with similar challenges. For instance, the successful implementation of afforestation and agroforestry initiatives in Southeast Nigeria as a means of enhancing the productivity of farming business demonstrates their potential as nature-based solutions to climate change that can be scaled up in similar agro-ecosystems. As climate change continues to pose challenges to agricultural systems across the continent, sharing and scaling up these effective practices can contribute significantly to building climate-resilient farming communities and ensuring food security for future generations in sub-Saharan Africa. 4.5 Constraints to adapting traditional agriculture to climate change Smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa face multifaceted challenges as they seek to adapt traditional agriculture to climate change. Lead farmers in the present study reported that poor agricultural extension services, pest and disease vulnerability, and inadequate dissemination of climate change information due to limited extension services are factors that hinder climate change adaptation, which corroborates the research conducted by Satishkumar et al. (2020). Studies in Nigeria and Ghana have highlighted constraints such as inadequate finance, scarcity of labor, inadequate access to climate information, and lack of access to weather information as significant barriers to farmers' efforts to adapt to climate change (Abegunde et al., 2019; Ige et al., 2021). Additionally, unpredictable weather conditions have been identified as a serious constraint to climate change adaptation strategies in Northern Ghana, affecting arable crop farmers' choice of adaptation strategies (Ige et al., 2021). On the other hand, findings showed that farmers do not have the knowledge to determine the level of accuracy of their climate information, because they never had real-time access to climate information. However, Fagariba et al. (2018) suggested that the inadequacy, inaccuracy, and inconsistency of climatic information available to farmers pose constraints in weather forecasting as an adaptation strategy to climate change. Furthermore, the high cost of accessing weather forecast information and its incompatibility with farmers' needs also hampers the adoption of weather forecasting as a reliable means of coping with the effects of climate change (Ojo et al., 2018). The result of the factor analysis resolved the constraints encountered by farmers into two components namely technical production and climate information problems. This is in tandem with the findings of Autio et al. (2021) who found that smallholder farmers in Southeast Kenya face challenges in adopting climate-smart agricultural practices due to limited access to productive resources and climate uncertainty. This is probably because formal climate adaptation strategies in sub-Saharan Africa often fail to consider the agency of smallholder farmers, leading to a disconnect between the strategies and the farmers' actual adaptation practices and needs. Addressing these constraints is crucial for the successful implementation of climate-smart agricultural practices and the resilience of agricultural systems in the region. 4.6 Possible strategies to adapt and mitigate the effect of climate change in traditional agricultural systems Climate change poses significant challenges to traditional agricultural systems in sub-Saharan Africa. Smallholder farmers in the region have been adapting to a changing climate, but there is a need for more comprehensive strategies to mitigate its effects. Farmers in the study area indicated that the use of climate-smart agriculture, the use of resistant crop varieties, afforestation, and other identified strategies can effectively mitigate the effects of climate change. This finding aligns with the research conducted by Ali et al. (2019), who highlighted the importance of using resistant crop varieties to adapt and build resilience to the effects of climate change. Resistant crops are known to survive and complete their life cycles even in adverse environmental conditions, providing a useful adaptation strategy (Barasa et al., 2021). Similarly, Jellason et al. (2022) indicated that on-farm adaptation options, agro-ecological intensification (AEI) practices, diversification and intercropping, adoption of improved crop varieties and soil and water management practices are crucial adaptation strategies to climate change in sub-Saharan Africa dry lands. The results further demonstrate that farmers have developed and tested various strategies to reduce the effects of climate change. This highlights their proactive approach to adopting measures to mitigate climate change and their ability to innovate and adapt to the changing environment. The results from the factor analysis categorized the strategies adopted by farmers into two categories namely agronomic methods and research methods for adaptation. Farmers indicated that adjusting the timing of farm operations, availability of extension services, incorporating crop residues into the soil, provision of mulching materials, infrastructure, and adoption of resistant crops and afforestation, are vital agronomic strategies to adapt traditional agriculture to climate change. In terms of the research methods to adaptations, farmers highlight the importance of proper seed conservation, availability of adequate farm inputs, and increased investment in agricultural research and development as crucial aspects to address in enhancing the resilience of their agricultural systems to climate change. 5 Conclusion This study provides valuable insights into the socioeconomic characteristics of farmers and their practices in adapting to climate change. The findings highlight the significant role of women in rural areas and their involvement in sustainable agriculture practices, as evidenced by a higher percentage of female respondents. The large household size and relatively low-income levels underscore the importance of agriculture as a primary source of livelihood for these farmers. Farmers have considerable experience addressing climate change issues, indicating their potential to collaborate and implement effective adaptation and mitigation strategies. However, the study also reveals the reliance on limited sources of climate change information, such as radio and fellow farmers, indicating the need for improved dissemination channels and access to diverse sources of knowledge. The study highlights the prevalent use of climate-smart traditional agricultural practices among indigenous people, including organic manure application and mixed farming, demonstrating farmers' proactive approach to mitigating the effects of climate change. These practices enhance soil fertility and moisture retention and improve crop productivity and resilience. Nevertheless, the study identifies constraints such as poor extension services, limited access to climate information, and technical challenges that hinder effective adaptation. These constraints require enhanced support systems, policy interventions, and agricultural research and development investments. In light of the findings, promoting climate-smart agriculture, the use of resistant crop varieties, afforestation, and sustainable farming practices emerge as essential strategies to mitigate the effects of climate change. By addressing the identified constraints and building upon farmers' existing knowledge and experiences, we can enhance their resilience, improve agricultural productivity, and contribute to sustainable rural development. 5.1 Policy implications of the findings • Strengthen extension services and diversify information sources: Governments should invest in and strengthen extension services to provide farmers with up-to-date climate change information, area-specific weather cues, agricultural best practices, and new technologies. And promote the use of diverse information sources, including indigenous channels, digital platforms and community-based knowledge sharing. • Promote climate-smart agricultural practices: Encourage the adoption of climate-smart agricultural practices through incentives, subsidies, and training programs. Governments should support research and development in climate-resilient crop varieties and livestock breeds. • Increase investment in agricultural research: Allocate more funding to agricultural research and innovation to develop climate-resilient technologies, improved crop varieties, and sustainable farming practices. • Access to credit for climate-resilient infrastructure: Facilitate access to credit and financial services for farmers to invest in climate-resilient infrastructure, such as irrigation systems, drought-resistant seeds, and storage facilities. • Supportive policies and collaborative networks: Create a conducive policy environment that encourages sustainable agricultural practices and promotes collaboration among various stakeholders, including government agencies, NGOs, and research institutions. • Capacity-Building Workshops and Progress Monitoring: Organize capacity-building workshops and training programs for farmers, extension workers, and other stakeholders to enhance their knowledge and skills in climate adaptation and mitigation.

Mbah3 1Department of Sustainability in Agriculture, Food Production and Food Technology, Hungarian University of Agricultural and Life Sciences, Godollo, Hungary 2Department of Agricultural Extension, University of Nigeria, Nsukka, Nigeria 3Department of Animal Science, University of Nigeria, Nsukka, Nigeria Introduction: Sub-Saharan Africa faces increasingly unpredictable and extreme weather patterns due to climate change, posing significant threats to food security and rural livelihoods. Traditional agriculture, deeply rooted in the region's history and culture, is particularly vulnerable to these changes. This study investigates the adaptation strategies of traditional agricultural farmers to climate change using southeast Nigeria as a microcosm of the broader challenges facing sub-Saharan Africa. Methods: Multistage sampling procedure was used to select 75 farmer group leaders in the study region. Cross-sectional data were collected through semi-structured interview schedules and focus group discussions. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and principal component analysis using Varimax rotated matrix. Results: Findings showed that farmers rely on face-to-face discussions with neighbors (76.0%), fellow farmers (66.7%), and radio (54.7%) as their primary sources of information on climate change. Results showed that traditional adaptation practices such as use of organic manure (x¯ = 3.89), traditional organic composting (x¯ = 3.80), afforestation (x¯ = 3.71), agroforestry (x¯ = 3.61) were the topmost traditional agricultural practices use to cushion the effect of climate change. Conserving the overall soil health, soil moisture retention, reducing CO2 emissions and maintaining crop productivity were the major reasons for using the traditional approaches. Climate-induced drought and high cost of accessing weather information (x¯ = 1.93), and inadequate funding (x¯ = 1.92), among others were the key constraints to adaptation. Discussion: Results showed that farmers prioritize agronomic manipulation and integrated research approaches as key strategies to adapting traditional agriculture to climate anomalies. Although farmers used their indigenous practices, continuous learning and improvement through capacity-building workshops and progress monitoring are essential for effective climate change adaptation. Policymakers should invest in promoting indigenous knowledge, provide access to credit for climate-resilient infrastructure, promote climate-smart agricultural practices and foster collaborative research as the cornerstone for sustainable rural development. 1 Introduction Sub-Saharan Africa, a vast and diverse region characterized by its rich cultural heritage and ecological variety, has long been recognized as a crucial battleground in the fight against climate change and its devastating consequences (Thompson et al., 2010). The region is particularly vulnerable to climate change, with multiple biophysical, political, and socioeconomic stresses interacting to affect rural communities, where agriculture is a major lifeline. Studies consistently predict decreased crop productivity, land degradation, high market prices, and negative impacts on livelihoods, exacerbating food insecurity in the region (Emediegwu et al., 2022; Oyelami et al., 2023). Climate change is intensifying food insecurity across sub-Saharan Africa, and leading to changes in yield and area growth, higher food prices, reduced calorie availability, and growing childhood malnutrition (Ringler et al., 2010). Salgado Baptista et al. (2022) projected the crop yield, especially in key staples, in the region to decline by 5–17% by 2050 due to rising temperatures and rainfall volatility. Successive weather shocks, such as droughts and floods, significantly raise food insecurity, particularly in countries where agricultural productivity is already below the global average (Salgado Baptista et al., 2022). With a predominantly agrarian economy dominated by stallholder farmers and a heavy reliance on traditional agricultural practices rooted in centuries of local knowledge and practices, the nations of sub-Saharan Africa are acutely vulnerable to the adverse impacts of a changing climate. Nigeria, as the most populous country in Africa, serves as a microcosm of the broader challenges and opportunities facing sub-Saharan Africa. It plays a pivotal role in the region's agricultural landscape and is emblematic of the broader climate adaptation issues faced by many nations in sub-Saharan Africa. Nigeria is estimated to contribute 14% of Africa's agriculture GDP, making it one of the top three African countries with the highest GDP contribution from agriculture (Oyaniran and Omomia, 2018). Between January and March 2021, agriculture contributed to 22.35% of Nigeria's GDP, with over 140 million Nigerians engaged in the sector mainly at a subsistence level. On formal level, more than 36% (above 28.9 million) of Nigeria's labor force was employed in agriculture, with over 80% of the agricultural workforce being smallholder farmers (FAO, 2019; Mayong et al., 2021; International Trade Administration, 2023). Nigeria possesses an abundance of arable land and a favorable climate to produce various crops, including maize, cassava, guinea corn, yam, beans, millet, and rice (FAO, 2019). However, despite its significant contribution to the economy, Nigeria's agricultural sector faces formidable challenges such as climate change and climate-induced socio-economic stressors. These challenges have stifled agricultural productivity, affecting the sector's contribution to the country's GDP and leading to increased food imports due to population growth (FAO, 2019). The impacts of climate change in Nigeria are characterized by increasing climate variability, leading to more intense and untimely rainfall, land degradation, flash floods, landslides, and gully erosion (Ghosh, 2019; World Bank, 2022). By 2009, an estimated 6,000 gullies were destroying infrastructure, farmland, and real estate across rural and urban Nigeria, causing fear and despair among the population (World Bank, 2022). The climate change-induced losses and unsustainable use of resources have elevated themselves to a real development challenge in Nigeria, particularly along the coastal states in the south and the northern frontline states, thwarting the age-old rhythms of traditional agriculture which are rooted in centuries of local knowledge and practices. The negative impacts of climate change on Nigeria's agriculture have been observed predominantly in the northern, northeastern, southwestern and southeast regions, which experience extreme weather conditions (Tajudeen et al., 2022; World Bank, 2022). The loss of life and property due to sudden, unpredictable, and uncontrollable floods is a nightmare for many Nigerians, destroying crops, farms, lands, and houses. The agricultural sector, which is the country's economic mainstay, is also grappling with lower crop yields, food insecurity, deepening poverty, forced displacement, labor inefficiency due to high temperatures and conflicts due to drought, flooding, sea level rise, erosion, and rapid decline in earth's limiting resources (Brouziyne et al., 2018; Obaji et al., 2022; United Nations Development Programme, 2023). In 2022 alone, climate-induced pests and diseases insurgence caused crop losses of up to 80% in some areas, impacting 1.5–200,000 hectares of land, and more than 20% of crops experienced post-harvest losses in several states (Adegwu, 2022). Major crops affected included maize, rice, sorghum, millet, soybean, groundnut, cowpea, root and tubers, fruits, vegetables, and tree crops in 33 states (Adegwu, 2022; Rizzo et al., 2023). The country's tropical climate is characterized by high temperatures, humidity, and rainfall, with larger amounts of rainfall experienced in the south and southeast regions of the country. Wind patterns are influenced by Nigeria's location and topography, largely due to the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) which brings moist winds from the Atlantic Ocean during the wet season and dry winds from the Sahara Desert during the dry season (Dia et al., 2023), which influences the annual temperature. The Nigeria temperature records indicate an average increase of 1.4–1.9°C, with predictions of further increases of 2–5°C by the end of the century if no decisive action is taken (Brouziyne et al., 2018). Nigeria is already experiencing the adverse effects of climate change, as with natural disasters are occurring more frequently and with greater intensity. These multi-dimensional adverse effects have not only hampered the ability of the agricultural sector to meet the country's food demands but have also disrupted the traditional roles of agriculture in Nigeria's economy, leading to a shift from being a net food exporter to an importer (Onyeneke et al., 2021). The cumulative agricultural imports of the country stood at N3.35 trillion between 2016 and 2019, which was four times higher than the agricultural export of N803 billion within the same period (FAO, 2019). Therefore, it is crucial to explore and implement interdisciplinary adaptation strategies that can enhance the sustainability and resilience of agri-food systems to climate anomalies. Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) has emerged as a competent response to the challenges posed by climate change on agriculture in rural areas. It entails the integration of traditional agricultural practices with modern techniques. Traditional agriculture, rooted in indigenous knowledge, cultural beliefs, and sustainable practices, offers valuable insights into adapting agricultural systems to a changing climate (Tsado, 2019). The approach of CSA is recognized for its potential to enhance farm productivity and incomes, adaptation, and resilience to climate change in rural African context (Abegunde and Obi, 2022). CSA offers a comprehensive strategy for addressing the interconnected challenges faced by smallholder farmers in African countries, focusing on three core goals: increasing agricultural productivity, adapting and building resilience to climate change, and developing opportunities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture (Obaji et al., 2022). Additionally, the FAO emphasizes that CSA is an approach that helps guide actions to transform agri-food systems toward green and climate-resilient practices, addressing challenges related to climate change and agriculture (FAO, 2023). However, CSA is not a one-size-fits-all approach and requires tailoring to specific climate risks faced by different farming communities, regions, and ecosystems. While CSA offers a solution to many of the secondary and tertiary problems caused by climate shocks, it is still not a familiar solution to climate adaptation and mitigation in last-mile communities. The effective utilization of CSA at grassroots is not just about understanding “how its works” but in appreciating the intricate web of cultural, economic, ecological, and technological factors that influence this adaptation tactics. Rural communities in sub-Saharan Africa are adapting their traditional agriculture to climate change through a variety of strategies and practices. Indigenous peoples and local communities are leveraging traditional knowledge and improved crop varieties to cope with extreme weather and environmental changes caused by climate change (Swiderska, 2011). Traditional agricultural practices, which have been developed over centuries, are proving to be valuable in building resilience and adapting to the impacts of climate change (Singh and Singh, 2017). Adjustments in planting dates, crop varieties, drainage systems, using advanced technologies and land management regimes to maintain yields and soil fertility (Arbuckle et al., 2015), are crucial on-the-ground strategies used by local farmers to counter the adverse effects of climatic changes. Traditional practices, such as agroforestry, intercropping, crop rotation, cover cropping, traditional organic composting, and integrated crop-animal farming, have demonstrated the potential to improve crop productivity and mitigate climate change impacts (Tripathi et al., 2019; Mashi et al., 2022). These practices, honed over thousands of years by indigenous farmers and local communities, provide valuable adaptation strategies in the face of climate uncertainties. Traditional agricultural practices have the potential to adapt and mitigate climate change through its unique agroecological features. They increase agrobiodiversity and resilience of agroecosystems, are low-cost, energy-efficient, and based on locally available resources (Singh and Singh, 2017). It is characterized by high productivity, biodiversity conservation, low energy inputs, and climate change mitigation (Singh and Singh, 2017). Therefore, integrating traditional knowledge into climate change policies is seen as a cost-effective, climate-smart approach and sustainable adaptation strategy to climate variability. While there is a growing recognition of the role of traditional knowledge in adapting agriculture to climate change, the role of indigenous knowledge and adaptive practices remains largely undervalued by decision-makers. Negotiating parties in international climate talks tend to focus on intensifying production through modern agriculture, overlooking the potential of traditional knowledge in adaptation (Swiderska, 2011). The unsustainable transition from traditional agriculture to modern methods in rural communities has led to the loss of crop genetic resources and environmental sustainability challenges, exacerbating the effects of climate change. Therefore, there is an urgent need to rediscover and re-implement traditional agricultural practices while integrating them with modern approaches to enhance the socio-ecological integrity of agroecosystems (Shittu et al., 2021). Ricart et al. (2023) analyzed a portfolio of 435 articles collected from WoS and Scopus databases between 2010 and 2020, finding that farmers are in a favorable position to offer first-hand observations and provide a deeper understanding of climate change manifestation, relevance, effects, and narratives. Therefore, farmers' knowledge provides a framework for appraising and incorporating new ideas, experiences, and information into existing systems (Haradhan, 2017). This study explored the adaptation strategies employed by farmers to mitigate the impacts of climate change on their indigenous agricultural system using southeast Nigeria as a model region for all riparian regions in sub-Saharan Africa. The specific objective of the study entails identifying the key climate change information sources by farmers; elicit the effective traditional adaptation practices farmers use to cushion the effect of climate change; examine the possible reasons for using traditional approaches to climate change adaptation, identify the constraints to adaptation, and the effective strategies to adapt and mitigate the effect of climate change. The grand objective of the study is to provide grassroots insights and recommendations for fostering sustainability and climate-resilient agri-food systems in sub-Saharan Africa. 2 Methodology The study was carried out in Southeast Nigeria, specifically within the geographical coordinates of latitudes 04° 17′N and 07° 06′N and longitudes 05° 23′E and 09° 28′E, as described in Macmillian's 2009 report. This region covers an area spanning 29,908 square kilometers and is inhabited by ~16,381,729 people, according to the Nigeria. National Bureau of Statistics (2007). It encompasses the territories of Abia state, Anambra state, Ebonyi state, Enugu state, and Imo state (see Figure 1). The climate of the Southeast can be broadly characterized as tropical, featuring distinct wet and dry seasons. It falls within the tropical belt, with early rainfall typically occurring in January/February and the full onset of the rainy season in March, concluding in November each year. The dry season typically lasts for 4–5 months, with the highest rainfall occurring from July to October, with a slight respite in August. On average, the region experiences an annual rainfall of ~1,952 mm, and the mean daily and annual temperatures are around 28 and 27°C, respectively (Igbokwe et al., 2008). Southeast Nigeria is primarily an agricultural area, with predominantly sandy and often loose and porous soil types. The most commonly cultivated crops in this region include cassava, rice, yam, cocoyam, maize, plantain/banana, cashew, oil palm, and coconut. Additionally, the major livestock raised in the area consist of goats, sheep, and poultry. In the southeastern region, the effects of climate change are readily noticeable, manifested in increased instances of flooding, landslides, and erosion, which have resulted in the loss of lives, homes, farmlands, properties, and roads, among other adverse consequences (Agwu and Okhimamhe, 2009). Figure 1 Figure 1. Map of southeast Nigeria. Source: Macmillian Atlas Series 2009. The population for the study comprised all farmers and relevant stakeholders operating in difficult-to-reach communities in the study region. Respondents were selected using a multi-stage sampling procedure. In the first stage, the five states that make up the Southeast Nigeria were selected purposefully to have good spread and depth of data and local perspectives. In the second stage, three senatorial zones were randomly selected in each state, given a total of 15 senatorial zones. In the third stage, five representative lead-farmers each were randomly selected from each of the 15 senatorial zones, given a total of 75 farmers used for the study. Data were collected using a semi-structure interview schedule and focus group discussion based on the specific objectives. The reliability of the instrument was tested using the Cronbach Alpha coefficient for internal consistency. The instrument was validated by experts in the Department of Agricultural Extension, University of Nigeria, Nsukka. Personal data, such as age (in years), gender (male or female), marital status (single, married, divorced/separated, and widowed), education (number of years spent in school), farming experience (years), household size (number of persons currently in the household), household monthly income (naira), estimated annual earnings (naira), access to extension service (number of times in the past 1 year), membership to the social organization(s), and access to credit facilities, were collected. Sources of information on climate change were collected by asking respondents to tick “Yes” or “No” from a list of information sources. Data on the effective traditional adaptation practices used to cushion the effects of climate change were collected by providing a list of perceived traditional practices. Respondents were required to rate the effective adaptive practices on a four-point Likert-type scale of very effective (4), effective (3), a little effective (2) and not effective (1). A mean score (2.5) was obtained. Variables with a mean score ≥2.5 were regarded as effective practices. Information on possible reasons for using traditional approaches for climate change adaptation were obtained by providing a list of variables for the respondents. Respondents were asked to rank the importance of traditional practices to their climate adaptation from a list of practices on a 3-point Likert scale of very important (3), important (2) and not important (1). A mean score (2) was obtained and all the variables with mean score ≥2 were regarded as important to adaptive capacity. Data on constraints to adaptation and mitigation were collected by asking the respondents to rank their constraints on a 3-point Likert scale of major constraint (2), minor constraint (1), not a constraint (0)—with a mean score of one. Data on the effectiveness of the strategies to mitigate the effect of climate change was measured by asking respondents to choose from a list of variables provided. Their responses were captured on a four-point Likert-type scale of very effective (4), effective (3), little effective (2), and not effective (1). A mean score (2.5) was obtained. Responses with a mean score ≥2.5 were regarded as effective. Excerpts from semi structure interviews and focus group discussions were reported in the result section of the article. Data obtained were analyzed with descriptive statistics (percentages, mean, and standard deviation) and principal component analysis using Varimax rotated factors analysis—through the IBM SPSS Statistics version 21 software. 3 Results 3.1 Socioeconomic characteristics of the farmers According to Table 1, results reveal that 52.0% of the respondents were female, while 48.0% were male. Regarding age distribution, most respondents (28.0%) fell within the 31–40 age range. Approximately 24.0% were aged between 41 and 50, 20.0% were 60 and above, and 18.7% were 30 and below. Only 9.3% were between 51 and 60 years old. The mean age of the farmers was 46.11, suggesting the active participation of middle-aged individuals in traditional agriculture. Regarding household size, a significant proportion (72.0%) of respondents had a household size of 5–8 persons, while 12.0% had 1–4 persons, and 16.0% had 8 or more persons. The results also indicate that the mean monthly household income was ₦20,093.33. Table 1 Table 1. Socioeconomic characteristics of the respondents (n = 75). 3.2 Sources of information by farmers on climate change adaptation The results in Table 2 indicate that most (76.0%) respondents obtain information on climate change, adaptation, and mitigation through face-to-face discussions with neighbors. This implies that community-based community approaches could be highly effective in disseminating information about climate change. Leveraging indigenous communication channels such as implementing community meetings or local discussion groups could be a strategic way to spread awareness and knowledge on climate adaptation and mitigation measures. Additionally, 66.7% of the respondents acquired information from fellow farmers. This implies that farmers probably trust and value the experiences and knowledge of their peers. Programs that engage local farmers as educators or facilitators could leverage this trust and peer influence for effective communication on climate resilience building. The reliance on radio by more than half 54.7% of respondents highlights its importance as a traditional but still relevant medium, especially in areas where digital connectivity might be limited. Radio programs focused on climate change, featuring expert advice, success stories from other farmers, and practical tips for adaptation and mitigation, could be a very effective outreach tool. Other information sources include videos (29.3%), newsletters on climate change (22.7%), internet (21.3%), television (20.0%), and among others. The variety of climate change information sources used by farmers underscores the need for a multi-channel communication strategy—since informal channels (neighbors and fellow farmers) could brood risk of misinformation or incomplete information being circulated. Table 2 Table 2. Source of information of farmers on climate changes (n = 75). 3.3 Effective traditional adaptation practices farmers use to cushion the effect of climate change In Table 3 show the traditional adaptation practices farmers use to cushion the effect of climate change. The traditional adaptation practices used include use of organic manure (x¯ = 3.89), traditional organic composting (x¯ = 3.80), afforestation (x¯ = 3.71), agroforestry (x¯ = 3.61), crop rotation (x¯ = 3.40), and mulching (x¯ = 3.37). These practices not only help in adapting to climate change but also contribute to mitigating its effects by enhancing carbon sequestration and biodiversity. For instance, the use of organic manure by the study participants is due to their accessibility, cost-effectiveness, or perceived effectiveness in improving soil health and resilience against climate variability. Excerpts from the focus group discussion indicate that farmers unanimously agree that [“…they use organic manure due to their accessibility, cost-effectiveness, or perceived effectiveness in improving soil health and resilience against climate variability…”]. Hence, these practices indicate a level of knowledge and adaptation to local climatic conditions. Table 3 Table 3. Traditional adaptation practices farmers use to cushion the effect of climate change (n = 75). Other traditional adaptation practices include intercropping (x¯ = 3.36), planting of cover crops and irrigation (x¯ = 3.29), integrated crop-animal farming (x¯ = 3.21), bush fallow practices (x¯ = 3.13), and among others. The use of intercropping and integrated crop-animal farming implies that indigenous people and communities prioritizes diversification as a key risk management strategy against the backdrop of climate change. Additionally, the use of irrigation, bush fallowing and covering crops indicates an awareness of and response to the need for optimal resource utilization, maintenance of soil health and sustainability, which is crucial for long-term agricultural productivity in the face of climate change. 3.4 Possible reasons for using traditional approaches to climate change adaptation Table 4 presents the key reasons for using traditional approaches to climate change adaptation. The reasons identified include increased soil fertility (x¯ = 2.95), aeration of soil (x¯ = 2.85), reduction of soil erosion (x¯ = 2.73), increase in soil moisture (x¯ = 2.03), enhancement of soil structure and aggregation (x¯ = 2.79), promotion of mineralization of nitrogen-containing compounds in the soil through the use of leguminous crops (x¯ = 2.68), reduction of nutrient loss from the soil (x¯ = 2.73), reduction of chemical pollution in the soil (x¯ = 2.33), and enhancement of agro-biodiversity through intercropping of legumes (x¯ = 2.56). This implies that farmers are aware of the importance of soil health in sustainable farming and climate change adaptation. This reflects a desire to maintain sustainable, eco-friendly farming practices that not only benefit the current crop but also contribute to the long-term health of the farm ecosystem. The reliance on traditional methods to deliver these benefits indicates a strong base of traditional agricultural knowledge and practices well-suited to local environmental conditions that have been passed down through generations. While these traditional practices are beneficial, there is potential for enhancing their effectiveness through the integration of scientific research and modern agricultural techniques. Table 4 Table 4. Possible reasons for using traditional approaches to climate change adaptation. 3.5 Constraints to adapting traditional agriculture to climate change Table 5 presents the constraints identified by the respondents to the use of traditional adaptation strategies. The major constraints to adaptation include climate variation leading to drought and high cost of accessing weather information (x¯ = 1.93), and inadequate funding (x¯ = 1.92). Access to micro-climate cues and finances are crucial in building local adaptation strategies. High cost of accessing reliable weather information frustrates traditional adaptive measures, making it difficult for farmers to plan and make informed climate-smart decisions effectively. It is therefore imperative to provide a more accessible, affordable, and accurate weather forecasting services tailored for farmers alongside financial assistance programs, subsidies, or microfinance solutions targeted at smallholder farmers. Participants also indicated that lack of technical knowledge and know-how (x¯ = 1.89) pose a major challenge to adapt. Mrs. Ngozika, a rural farmer from the study participant stated thus [“…I do not know the practical steps I could take to improve my farm activities in this era of climate change…”]. This implies a gap in the knowledge and skills necessary to implement effective adaptation strategies, which could probably be due to inadequate extension services or training programs. Inadequate infrastructure (x¯ = 1.87), such as roads and storage facilities, limits the ability of farmers to adapt to and mitigate the impacts of climate change. There is a need for governmental and non-governmental bodies to invest in rural infrastructure to support agricultural activities. Also, inadequate access to climate change information (x¯ = 1.85) present a formidable obstacle to rural adaptive capacities. This aligns with the high cost of accessing weather information and highlights a broader issue of information accessibility. Vulnerability to pests and diseases (x¯ = 1.83) resulting from climate change bedevils farmers adaptation efforts. Therefore, research into and promotion of climate-resilient crop varieties and integrated pest management practices are crucial for traditional agricultural systems. Other constraints faced by farmers include inadequate credit facilities (x¯ = 1.79), poor agricultural program and service delivery (x¯ = 1.69), high economic losses from farming (x¯ = 1.65), among others. Table 5 Table 5. Constraints to adaptation. Table 6 presents the results of the factor analysis of the constraints to adaptation. The variables with a loading of 0.4 score and above were included in naming the factors. Variables that loaded in more than one factor or had loadings below 0.4 were not used. Two key factors were identified and named: a technical problem (Factor 1) and a climate information problem (Factor 2). Under the technical problem (Factor 1), the major constraints identified by farmers include poor agricultural program and service delivery (loading = 0.768), high cost of farm operations (loading = 0.663), lack of skilled laboratory facilities for farm practices (loading = 0.650), inconsistent government policies (loading = 0.580), lack of extension services for providing information to farmers (loading = 0.539), high economic losses from farming (loading = 0.500), and vulnerability to pests and diseases (loading = 0.487). In Factor 2, the climate informational problem includes the high cost of accessing weather information (loading = 0.692) and drought climate variation (loading = 0.515). The factor analysis provides a clear framework for understanding the complex array of challenges in agricultural adaptation, emphasizing the need for comprehensive, well-coordinated responses that address both immediate technical issues and longer-term climate information accessibility challenges. Table 6 Table 6. Varimax rotated factors on constraints to adaptation. 3.6 Possible strategies to adapt and mitigate the effect of climate change Table 7 presents the respondents' responses regarding adopting respective mitigation measures. The major strategies adopted by farmers include the use of organic manure (x¯ = 3.87), use of resistant crops (score x¯ = 3.85), use of drought-resistant crops (x¯ = 3.68), and use of flood-tolerant crops (x¯ = 3.73). Farmers can adopt resistant crop varieties that are better suited to withstand the impacts of climate change, such as drought, extreme temperatures, and pests. Also, afforestation (planting trees; x¯ = 3.67), and use of use of cover crops (x¯ = 3.47) are important strategies to adapt and mitigate the effect of climate change. Excerpts from the focus group discussion indicate that farmers unanimously agree that [“…Planting palm, orange, and gmelina help remove climate pollutants from the atmosphere, contribute to climate change mitigation and provide additional benefits such as soil conservation and biodiversity enhancement…”]. Furthermore, the participant indicated access to reliable weather forecasting services (x¯ = 3.86) could help farmers make informed decisions and adapt their farming practices to changing climate conditions, thereby mitigating risks associated with irregular rainfall patterns. Famers also indicated that climate-smart agriculture practices (x¯ = 3.93) are important adaptation strategies. Implementing climate-smart agricultural practices, such as conservation tillage, diversified crop rotations, and rotational grazing, could effectively mitigate climate change impacts by sequestering carbon and enhancing soil health. Table 7 Table 7. Possible strategies to adopt and mitigate the effect of climate change (n = 75). Other important strategies identified by the respondents include incorporation of residues into the soil (x¯ = 3.23), proper conservation of seeds (x¯ = 3.75), provision of adequate mulching materials (x¯ = 3.40), among others. These strategies align with the principles of climate-resilient agriculture, which aims to enhance the adaptive capacity of agricultural systems and reduce their vulnerability to climate change while contributing to climate change mitigation. Table 8 shows the Varimax rotated factors of possible strategies to adopt and mitigate the effect of climate change. Variables that had loadings of 0.4 and above being included in naming the factors. Variables that loaded in more than one factor or had loadings below 0.4 were not used. Two factors were identified and named: agronomic methods (Factor 1) and research methods (Factor 2). Under the agronomic methods (Factor 1), the major strategies identified by farmers include changing the timing of farm operations (loading = 0.777), availability of extension service delivery (loading = 0.774), incorporation of residues into the soil (loading = 0.738), provision of adequate mulching materials (loading = 0.674), provision of infrastructure (loading = 0.550), use of resistant crops (loading = 0.535), and afforestation (loading = 0.414). In Factor 2, the research methods, the strategies identified are proper conservation of seeds (loading = 0.580), provision of adequate farm input supplies (loading = 0.437), and increased investment in agricultural research and development (loading = 0.424). Table 8 Table 8. Varimax rotated factors of possible strategies to adopt and mitigate the effect of climate change. 4 Discussion 4.1 Demographic characteristics of the farmers The United Nations reports that households in three Sub-Saharan African countries have an average of over 6 members each. Senegal stands out with one of the largest household sizes in Africa, averaging 10.8 members (United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division, 2019). These significant household sizes in Sub-Saharan Africa contribute to a valuable pool of labor for agricultural activities. The substantial household sizes in sub-Saharan Africa serve as a valuable labor reservoir for agricultural activities. Mr. Ode, a rural farmer said […I cannot afford machineries hence I use local labor, often involving family and friends…]. Compared to other regions such as North America and Europe, sub-Saharan Africa has larger average household size of 6.9 (Galal, 2023; Pew Research Center, 2023). This aligns with the result of this study of a mean household size of 6.43 people, indicating the families are relatively large and can contribute as a source of labor for farming activities. Thereby giving room for farming household to spend their extra income on other adaptive expenses. The empirical evidence from Swaziland underscored that sub-Saharan African countries could bear the brunt of climate change in terms of increased incidence of poverty and economic decline, with potential impacts on household welfare (Sam et al., 2021). The decrease in agricultural production due to the effects of climate change is a key contributing factor to farmers' reduced income. Findings showed that farmers have relatively low-income, indicating their reliance on income generated from the sales of their agricultural produce. This aligns firmly with related studies from sub-Saharan Africa (Ayanlade et al., 2018; Steinert et al., 2018; Ogada et al., 2020; Nwonu et al., 2022), which indicated that farmers within the region rely on personal savings. Farming experience is crucial to building climate resilience in traditional farming systems. Findings show that farmers have an average farming experience of 21.88 years, this implies that farmers in sub-Saharan Africa possess considerable experience addressing climate change issues in their farming practices, including adaptation and mitigation strategies (Sani and Chalchisa, 2016). However, support from governments and other organizations is crucial to enhance farmers' adaptation capacity and improve their access to resources and information. 4.2 Sources of information by farmers on climate change adaptation Smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa heavily rely on the environment for their livelihoods, making climate change adaptation crucial for their resilience. To achieve this, timely information on climate change adaptation strategies is vital. Although, there is limited information on the trend in climate information sources in sub-Saharan Africa. However, a study on smallholder farmers' climate resilience in Malawi and Ghana suggests that the relevance of information sources on climate change resilience is place-specific, and some sources may impede resilience (Amoak et al., 2023). Findings from the present study showed that across various survey regions, the main avenues through which individuals access information about climate change prominently include radio broadcasts, interactions with fellow farmers, and in-person discussions with neighbors. This widespread pattern of information dissemination aligns with the findings of multiple studies conducted not only in Anambra, as highlighted by Nwabugwu et al. (2019) and Uzochukwu et al. (2021), but also in diverse sub-Saharan African contexts. One of the noteworthy aspects of this information-sharing framework is the pivotal role of radio as a powerful and accessible medium for effectively communicating climate-related knowledge to diverse target groups across the region. According to and Antwi-Agyei et al. (2021) radio has proven to be a versatile tool in disseminating climate change information to both rural and urban communities, bridging information gaps, and promoting awareness and understanding of climate-related challenges. Additionally, community radio stations have been recognized for their ability to reach huge audiences and disseminate location-specific weather reporting, making them an effective tool for sharing climate information (Harvey et al., 2019; Global Center on Adaptation, 2023). This underscores the significance of radio as a primary and trusted source of climate-related information in sub-Saharan Africa. In addition to radio, the significance of peer interactions, particularly with fellow farmers and neighboring community members, emerges as a vital information source in the present study. A study on farmers' social networks and regional spillover effects in agricultural climate change mitigation emphasizes the positive influence of peer interactions on farmers' uptake of climate change adaptation measures (Kreft et al., 2023). Furthermore, a systematic review of smallholder farmers' climate change adaptation in sub-Saharan African indicated that knowledge integration and sharing within farming communities is important for adaptation to climate change (Jellason et al., 2022). This interpersonal exchange of knowledge within farming communities fosters the sharing of practical experiences, locally relevant adaptation strategies, and mitigation measures. Farmers can learn from one another's successes and challenges, making peer interactions a crucial component of climate change education and resilience-building efforts. It is important to acknowledge that while these channels are prevalent, there are variations in their prominence and effectiveness across sub-Saharan Africa's diverse regions and cultural contexts. 4.3 Effective traditional adaptation practices farmers use to cushion the effect of climate change Traditional adaptation practices are crucial for enhancing the climate change resilience of smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa. Findings show that all the tested traditional practices have high adoption rates as farmers utilize them to mitigate and adapt to climate change to minimize its effects. This aligns with the findings of the Crace (2019), which revealed that rural farmers have developed various strategies to reduce the impact of climate change, and these strategies have been tested and proven effective, reflecting farmers' perceptions and serving as effective mitigation and adaptation strategies. The increased application of organic manure by farmers serves multiple purposes, including enhancing soil fertility sustainably and increasing soil moisture content. Farmers noted that with rising temperatures and increased evapotranspiration caused by climate change, preserving moisture for crop use is crucial, making organic manure, planting of cover crops, bush fallow and mulching preferred options. They also emphasized that organic manure is cost-effective and readily available compared to inorganic fertilizers. This aligns with the findings of Quarshie et al. (2023) that traditional agricultural practitioners in sub-Saharan Africa implement on-farm adaptation options such as water management, and soil conservation techniques to combat climate change. Results showed that farmers deployed crop rotation, mixed cropping, intercropping, integrated crop-animal irrigation practices and shifting cultivation as key traditional soil and water management practices to adapt food crop production to climate change (Olumba et al., 2020; Benhin, 2021). This aligns with the findings of Naazie et al. (2023) who found that rural farmers in Ghana use crop diversification, intercropping, mixed farming and the adoption of improved crop varieties to adapt their agricultural production to climate change. Afforestation and agroforestry are important practices for promoting sustainable land use and mitigating the effects of climate change in sub-Saharan Africa. Results from the present study showed that farmers used afforestation and agroforestry techniques as an effective adaptation strategy as opposed mitigation strategy. These offers one of the most promising technological options for reversing soil degradation, restoring tree cover, and improving agricultural productivity in Africa. Famers reported the key agroforestry practices that helped them to adapt their agricultural system to climate change to include grazing or farming under savanna trees, growing coffee or cocoa under shade trees, planting fruit trees, sowing tree seeds on fallow land to speed up the restoration of fertility, planting “living” fences, windbreaks, or woodlots, combining trees, shrubs, and field crops in multistoried cropping systems, and growing crops between rows of nitrogen-fixing trees or shrubs (“alley cropping”). On the other hand, farmers also reported their engagement in tree planting campaigns in areas where there was no forest cover previously. In sub-Saharan Africa, afforestation programs have been implemented to combat deforestation and land degradation (Chomba et al., 2020). This is an effective traditional way of increasing soil cover, sequester carbon and mitigate the effects of climate change on rural agriculture. 4.4 Possible reasons for using traditional approaches to climate change adaptation Sub-Saharan African countries are incorporating traditional approaches to climate change adaptation due to their effectiveness and relevance to local conditions. Findings indicate that adopting traditional agricultural practices for climate change adaptation delivers multi-faceted benefits including enhancing soil quality and crop productivity by altering soil structure, promoting nutrient cycling, and reducing pests and diseases. Peoples and Baldock (2020) reported that crop rotation can increase the production of subsequent crops. Niggli et al. (2019) also stated that organic matter enhances soil resistance to drought and makes them adaptable to low and high rainfall conditions. Famers reported that improving over soil health, soil organic matter and crop yield, reducing greenhouse gas emission and enhancing resilience against climate variability are the major reasons why they use traditional approaches such as use of organic manure, traditional organic composting, afforestation and agroforestry, among others. The utilization of these techniques highlights the importance of diversifying agricultural practices to enhance climate resilience, which can serve as a model for other regions grappling with similar challenges. For instance, the successful implementation of afforestation and agroforestry initiatives in Southeast Nigeria as a means of enhancing the productivity of farming business demonstrates their potential as nature-based solutions to climate change that can be scaled up in similar agro-ecosystems. As climate change continues to pose challenges to agricultural systems across the continent, sharing and scaling up these effective practices can contribute significantly to building climate-resilient farming communities and ensuring food security for future generations in sub-Saharan Africa. 4.5 Constraints to adapting traditional agriculture to climate change Smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa face multifaceted challenges as they seek to adapt traditional agriculture to climate change. Lead farmers in the present study reported that poor agricultural extension services, pest and disease vulnerability, and inadequate dissemination of climate change information due to limited extension services are factors that hinder climate change adaptation, which corroborates the research conducted by Satishkumar et al. (2020). Studies in Nigeria and Ghana have highlighted constraints such as inadequate finance, scarcity of labor, inadequate access to climate information, and lack of access to weather information as significant barriers to farmers' efforts to adapt to climate change (Abegunde et al., 2019; Ige et al., 2021). Additionally, unpredictable weather conditions have been identified as a serious constraint to climate change adaptation strategies in Northern Ghana, affecting arable crop farmers' choice of adaptation strategies (Ige et al., 2021). On the other hand, findings showed that farmers do not have the knowledge to determine the level of accuracy of their climate information, because they never had real-time access to climate information. However, Fagariba et al. (2018) suggested that the inadequacy, inaccuracy, and inconsistency of climatic information available to farmers pose constraints in weather forecasting as an adaptation strategy to climate change. Furthermore, the high cost of accessing weather forecast information and its incompatibility with farmers' needs also hampers the adoption of weather forecasting as a reliable means of coping with the effects of climate change (Ojo et al., 2018). The result of the factor analysis resolved the constraints encountered by farmers into two components namely technical production and climate information problems. This is in tandem with the findings of Autio et al. (2021) who found that smallholder farmers in Southeast Kenya face challenges in adopting climate-smart agricultural practices due to limited access to productive resources and climate uncertainty. This is probably because formal climate adaptation strategies in sub-Saharan Africa often fail to consider the agency of smallholder farmers, leading to a disconnect between the strategies and the farmers' actual adaptation practices and needs. Addressing these constraints is crucial for the successful implementation of climate-smart agricultural practices and the resilience of agricultural systems in the region. 4.6 Possible strategies to adapt and mitigate the effect of climate change in traditional agricultural systems Climate change poses significant challenges to traditional agricultural systems in sub-Saharan Africa. Smallholder farmers in the region have been adapting to a changing climate, but there is a need for more comprehensive strategies to mitigate its effects. Farmers in the study area indicated that the use of climate-smart agriculture, the use of resistant crop varieties, afforestation, and other identified strategies can effectively mitigate the effects of climate change. This finding aligns with the research conducted by Ali et al. (2019), who highlighted the importance of using resistant crop varieties to adapt and build resilience to the effects of climate change. Resistant crops are known to survive and complete their life cycles even in adverse environmental conditions, providing a useful adaptation strategy (Barasa et al., 2021). Similarly, Jellason et al. (2022) indicated that on-farm adaptation options, agro-ecological intensification (AEI) practices, diversification and intercropping, adoption of improved crop varieties and soil and water management practices are crucial adaptation strategies to climate change in sub-Saharan Africa dry lands. The results further demonstrate that farmers have developed and tested various strategies to reduce the effects of climate change. This highlights their proactive approach to adopting measures to mitigate climate change and their ability to innovate and adapt to the changing environment. The results from the factor analysis categorized the strategies adopted by farmers into two categories namely agronomic methods and research methods for adaptation. Farmers indicated that adjusting the timing of farm operations, availability of extension services, incorporating crop residues into the soil, provision of mulching materials, infrastructure, and adoption of resistant crops and afforestation, are vital agronomic strategies to adapt traditional agriculture to climate change. In terms of the research methods to adaptations, farmers highlight the importance of proper seed conservation, availability of adequate farm inputs, and increased investment in agricultural research and development as crucial aspects to address in enhancing the resilience of their agricultural systems to climate change. 5 Conclusion This study provides valuable insights into the socioeconomic characteristics of farmers and their practices in adapting to climate change. The findings highlight the significant role of women in rural areas and their involvement in sustainable agriculture practices, as evidenced by a higher percentage of female respondents. The large household size and relatively low-income levels underscore the importance of agriculture as a primary source of livelihood for these farmers. Farmers have considerable experience addressing climate change issues, indicating their potential to collaborate and implement effective adaptation and mitigation strategies. However, the study also reveals the reliance on limited sources of climate change information, such as radio and fellow farmers, indicating the need for improved dissemination channels and access to diverse sources of knowledge. The study highlights the prevalent use of climate-smart traditional agricultural practices among indigenous people, including organic manure application and mixed farming, demonstrating farmers' proactive approach to mitigating the effects of climate change. These practices enhance soil fertility and moisture retention and improve crop productivity and resilience. Nevertheless, the study identifies constraints such as poor extension services, limited access to climate information, and technical challenges that hinder effective adaptation. These constraints require enhanced support systems, policy interventions, and agricultural research and development investments. In light of the findings, promoting climate-smart agriculture, the use of resistant crop varieties, afforestation, and sustainable farming practices emerge as essential strategies to mitigate the effects of climate change. By addressing the identified constraints and building upon farmers' existing knowledge and experiences, we can enhance their resilience, improve agricultural productivity, and contribute to sustainable rural development. 5.1 Policy implications of the findings • Strengthen extension services and diversify information sources: Governments should invest in and strengthen extension services to provide farmers with up-to-date climate change information, area-specific weather cues, agricultural best practices, and new technologies. And promote the use of diverse information sources, including indigenous channels, digital platforms and community-based knowledge sharing. • Promote climate-smart agricultural practices: Encourage the adoption of climate-smart agricultural practices through incentives, subsidies, and training programs. Governments should support research and development in climate-resilient crop varieties and livestock breeds. • Increase investment in agricultural research: Allocate more funding to agricultural research and innovation to develop climate-resilient technologies, improved crop varieties, and sustainable farming practices. • Access to credit for climate-resilient infrastructure: Facilitate access to credit and financial services for farmers to invest in climate-resilient infrastructure, such as irrigation systems, drought-resistant seeds, and storage facilities. • Supportive policies and collaborative networks: Create a conducive policy environment that encourages sustainable agricultural practices and promotes collaboration among various stakeholders, including government agencies, NGOs, and research institutions. • Capacity-Building Workshops and Progress Monitoring: Organize capacity-building workshops and training programs for farmers, extension workers, and other stakeholders to enhance their knowledge and skills in climate adaptation and mitigation. And also implement regular progress monitoring and evaluation to assess the effectiveness of climate adaptation efforts. • Enabling Environment for Continuous Learning and Improvement: Foster an environment that promotes continuous learning and improvement in agricultural practices. Encourage farmers to experiment with new techniques and technologies while providing them with the necessary support and resources. • Collaboration among policymakers, researchers, and local communities: Promote collaboration and coordination among policymakers, researchers, and local communities to ensure that climate-resilient and sustainable agricultural practices are developed, disseminated, and adopted effectively.

Traditional agriculture, deeply rooted in the region's history and culture, is particularly vulnerable to these changes. This study investigates the adaptation strategies of traditional agricultural farmers to climate change using southeast Nigeria as a microcosm of the broader challenges facing sub-Saharan Africa. Methods: Multistage sampling procedure was used to select 75 farmer group leaders in the study region. Cross-sectional data were collected through semi-structured interview schedules and focus group discussions. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and principal component analysis using Varimax rotated matrix. Results: Findings showed that farmers rely on face-to-face discussions with neighbors (76.0%), fellow farmers (66.7%), and radio (54.7%) as their primary sources of information on climate change. Results showed that traditional adaptation practices such as use of organic manure (x¯ = 3.89), traditional organic composting (x¯ = 3.80), afforestation (x¯ = 3.71), agroforestry (x¯ = 3.61) were the topmost traditional agricultural practices use to cushion the effect of climate change. Conserving the overall soil health, soil moisture retention, reducing CO2 emissions and maintaining crop productivity were the major reasons for using the traditional approaches. Climate-induced drought and high cost of accessing weather information (x¯ = 1.93), and inadequate funding (x¯ = 1.92), among others were the key constraints to adaptation. Discussion: Results showed that farmers prioritize agronomic manipulation and integrated research approaches as key strategies to adapting traditional agriculture to climate anomalies. Although farmers used their indigenous practices, continuous learning and improvement through capacity-building workshops and progress monitoring are essential for effective climate change adaptation. Policymakers should invest in promoting indigenous knowledge, provide access to credit for climate-resilient infrastructure, promote climate-smart agricultural practices and foster collaborative research as the cornerstone for sustainable rural development. 1 Introduction Sub-Saharan Africa, a vast and diverse region characterized by its rich cultural heritage and ecological variety, has long been recognized as a crucial battleground in the fight against climate change and its devastating consequences (Thompson et al., 2010). The region is particularly vulnerable to climate change, with multiple biophysical, political, and socioeconomic stresses interacting to affect rural communities, where agriculture is a major lifeline. Studies consistently predict decreased crop productivity, land degradation, high market prices, and negative impacts on livelihoods, exacerbating food insecurity in the region (Emediegwu et al., 2022; Oyelami et al., 2023). Climate change is intensifying food insecurity across sub-Saharan Africa, and leading to changes in yield and area growth, higher food prices, reduced calorie availability, and growing childhood malnutrition (Ringler et al., 2010). Salgado Baptista et al. (2022) projected the crop yield, especially in key staples, in the region to decline by 5–17% by 2050 due to rising temperatures and rainfall volatility. Successive weather shocks, such as droughts and floods, significantly raise food insecurity, particularly in countries where agricultural productivity is already below the global average (Salgado Baptista et al., 2022). With a predominantly agrarian economy dominated by stallholder farmers and a heavy reliance on traditional agricultural practices rooted in centuries of local knowledge and practices, the nations of sub-Saharan Africa are acutely vulnerable to the adverse impacts of a changing climate. Nigeria, as the most populous country in Africa, serves as a microcosm of the broader challenges and opportunities facing sub-Saharan Africa. It plays a pivotal role in the region's agricultural landscape and is emblematic of the broader climate adaptation issues faced by many nations in sub-Saharan Africa. Nigeria is estimated to contribute 14% of Africa's agriculture GDP, making it one of the top three African countries with the highest GDP contribution from agriculture (Oyaniran and Omomia, 2018). Between January and March 2021, agriculture contributed to 22.35% of Nigeria's GDP, with over 140 million Nigerians engaged in the sector mainly at a subsistence level. On formal level, more than 36% (above 28.9 million) of Nigeria's labor force was employed in agriculture, with over 80% of the agricultural workforce being smallholder farmers (FAO, 2019; Mayong et al., 2021; International Trade Administration, 2023). Nigeria possesses an abundance of arable land and a favorable climate to produce various crops, including maize, cassava, guinea corn, yam, beans, millet, and rice (FAO, 2019). However, despite its significant contribution to the economy, Nigeria's agricultural sector faces formidable challenges such as climate change and climate-induced socio-economic stressors. These challenges have stifled agricultural productivity, affecting the sector's contribution to the country's GDP and leading to increased food imports due to population growth (FAO, 2019). The impacts of climate change in Nigeria are characterized by increasing climate variability, leading to more intense and untimely rainfall, land degradation, flash floods, landslides, and gully erosion (Ghosh, 2019; World Bank, 2022). By 2009, an estimated 6,000 gullies were destroying infrastructure, farmland, and real estate across rural and urban Nigeria, causing fear and despair among the population (World Bank, 2022). The climate change-induced losses and unsustainable use of resources have elevated themselves to a real development challenge in Nigeria, particularly along the coastal states in the south and the northern frontline states, thwarting the age-old rhythms of traditional agriculture which are rooted in centuries of local knowledge and practices. The negative impacts of climate change on Nigeria's agriculture have been observed predominantly in the northern, northeastern, southwestern and southeast regions, which experience extreme weather conditions (Tajudeen et al., 2022; World Bank, 2022). The loss of life and property due to sudden, unpredictable, and uncontrollable floods is a nightmare for many Nigerians, destroying crops, farms, lands, and houses. The agricultural sector, which is the country's economic mainstay, is also grappling with lower crop yields, food insecurity, deepening poverty, forced displacement, labor inefficiency due to high temperatures and conflicts due to drought, flooding, sea level rise, erosion, and rapid decline in earth's limiting resources (Brouziyne et al., 2018; Obaji et al., 2022; United Nations Development Programme, 2023). In 2022 alone, climate-induced pests and diseases insurgence caused crop losses of up to 80% in some areas, impacting 1.5–200,000 hectares of land, and more than 20% of crops experienced post-harvest losses in several states (Adegwu, 2022). Major crops affected included maize, rice, sorghum, millet, soybean, groundnut, cowpea, root and tubers, fruits, vegetables, and tree crops in 33 states (Adegwu, 2022; Rizzo et al., 2023). The country's tropical climate is characterized by high temperatures, humidity, and rainfall, with larger amounts of rainfall experienced in the south and southeast regions of the country. Wind patterns are influenced by Nigeria's location and topography, largely due to the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) which brings moist winds from the Atlantic Ocean during the wet season and dry winds from the Sahara Desert during the dry season (Dia et al., 2023), which influences the annual temperature. The Nigeria temperature records indicate an average increase of 1.4–1.9°C, with predictions of further increases of 2–5°C by the end of the century if no decisive action is taken (Brouziyne et al., 2018). Nigeria is already experiencing the adverse effects of climate change, as with natural disasters are occurring more frequently and with greater intensity. These multi-dimensional adverse effects have not only hampered the ability of the agricultural sector to meet the country's food demands but have also disrupted the traditional roles of agriculture in Nigeria's economy, leading to a shift from being a net food exporter to an importer (Onyeneke et al., 2021). The cumulative agricultural imports of the country stood at N3.35 trillion between 2016 and 2019, which was four times higher than the agricultural export of N803 billion within the same period (FAO, 2019). Therefore, it is crucial to explore and implement interdisciplinary adaptation strategies that can enhance the sustainability and resilience of agri-food systems to climate anomalies. Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) has emerged as a competent response to the challenges posed by climate change on agriculture in rural areas. It entails the integration of traditional agricultural practices with modern techniques. Traditional agriculture, rooted in indigenous knowledge, cultural beliefs, and sustainable practices, offers valuable insights into adapting agricultural systems to a changing climate (Tsado, 2019). The approach of CSA is recognized for its potential to enhance farm productivity and incomes, adaptation, and resilience to climate change in rural African context (Abegunde and Obi, 2022). CSA offers a comprehensive strategy for addressing the interconnected challenges faced by smallholder farmers in African countries, focusing on three core goals: increasing agricultural productivity, adapting and building resilience to climate change, and developing opportunities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture (Obaji et al., 2022). Additionally, the FAO emphasizes that CSA is an approach that helps guide actions to transform agri-food systems toward green and climate-resilient practices, addressing challenges related to climate change and agriculture (FAO, 2023). However, CSA is not a one-size-fits-all approach and requires tailoring to specific climate risks faced by different farming communities, regions, and ecosystems. While CSA offers a solution to many of the secondary and tertiary problems caused by climate shocks, it is still not a familiar solution to climate adaptation and mitigation in last-mile communities. The effective utilization of CSA at grassroots is not just about understanding “how its works” but in appreciating the intricate web of cultural, economic, ecological, and technological factors that influence this adaptation tactics. Rural communities in sub-Saharan Africa are adapting their traditional agriculture to climate change through a variety of strategies and practices. Indigenous peoples and local communities are leveraging traditional knowledge and improved crop varieties to cope with extreme weather and environmental changes caused by climate change (Swiderska, 2011). Traditional agricultural practices, which have been developed over centuries, are proving to be valuable in building resilience and adapting to the impacts of climate change (Singh and Singh, 2017). Adjustments in planting dates, crop varieties, drainage systems, using advanced technologies and land management regimes to maintain yields and soil fertility (Arbuckle et al., 2015), are crucial on-the-ground strategies used by local farmers to counter the adverse effects of climatic changes. Traditional practices, such as agroforestry, intercropping, crop rotation, cover cropping, traditional organic composting, and integrated crop-animal farming, have demonstrated the potential to improve crop productivity and mitigate climate change impacts (Tripathi et al., 2019; Mashi et al., 2022). These practices, honed over thousands of years by indigenous farmers and local communities, provide valuable adaptation strategies in the face of climate uncertainties. Traditional agricultural practices have the potential to adapt and mitigate climate change through its unique agroecological features. They increase agrobiodiversity and resilience of agroecosystems, are low-cost, energy-efficient, and based on locally available resources (Singh and Singh, 2017). It is characterized by high productivity, biodiversity conservation, low energy inputs, and climate change mitigation (Singh and Singh, 2017). Therefore, integrating traditional knowledge into climate change policies is seen as a cost-effective, climate-smart approach and sustainable adaptation strategy to climate variability. While there is a growing recognition of the role of traditional knowledge in adapting agriculture to climate change, the role of indigenous knowledge and adaptive practices remains largely undervalued by decision-makers. Negotiating parties in international climate talks tend to focus on intensifying production through modern agriculture, overlooking the potential of traditional knowledge in adaptation (Swiderska, 2011). The unsustainable transition from traditional agriculture to modern methods in rural communities has led to the loss of crop genetic resources and environmental sustainability challenges, exacerbating the effects of climate change. Therefore, there is an urgent need to rediscover and re-implement traditional agricultural practices while integrating them with modern approaches to enhance the socio-ecological integrity of agroecosystems (Shittu et al., 2021). Ricart et al. (2023) analyzed a portfolio of 435 articles collected from WoS and Scopus databases between 2010 and 2020, finding that farmers are in a favorable position to offer first-hand observations and provide a deeper understanding of climate change manifestation, relevance, effects, and narratives. Therefore, farmers' knowledge provides a framework for appraising and incorporating new ideas, experiences, and information into existing systems (Haradhan, 2017). This study explored the adaptation strategies employed by farmers to mitigate the impacts of climate change on their indigenous agricultural system using southeast Nigeria as a model region for all riparian regions in sub-Saharan Africa. The specific objective of the study entails identifying the key climate change information sources by farmers; elicit the effective traditional adaptation practices farmers use to cushion the effect of climate change; examine the possible reasons for using traditional approaches to climate change adaptation, identify the constraints to adaptation, and the effective strategies to adapt and mitigate the effect of climate change. The grand objective of the study is to provide grassroots insights and recommendations for fostering sustainability and climate-resilient agri-food systems in sub-Saharan Africa. 2 Methodology The study was carried out in Southeast Nigeria, specifically within the geographical coordinates of latitudes 04° 17′N and 07° 06′N and longitudes 05° 23′E and 09° 28′E, as described in Macmillian's 2009 report. This region covers an area spanning 29,908 square kilometers and is inhabited by ~16,381,729 people, according to the Nigeria. National Bureau of Statistics (2007). It encompasses the territories of Abia state, Anambra state, Ebonyi state, Enugu state, and Imo state (see Figure 1). The climate of the Southeast can be broadly characterized as tropical, featuring distinct wet and dry seasons. It falls within the tropical belt, with early rainfall typically occurring in January/February and the full onset of the rainy season in March, concluding in November each year. The dry season typically lasts for 4–5 months, with the highest rainfall occurring from July to October, with a slight respite in August. On average, the region experiences an annual rainfall of ~1,952 mm, and the mean daily and annual temperatures are around 28 and 27°C, respectively (Igbokwe et al., 2008). Southeast Nigeria is primarily an agricultural area, with predominantly sandy and often loose and porous soil types. The most commonly cultivated crops in this region include cassava, rice, yam, cocoyam, maize, plantain/banana, cashew, oil palm, and coconut. Additionally, the major livestock raised in the area consist of goats, sheep, and poultry. In the southeastern region, the effects of climate change are readily noticeable, manifested in increased instances of flooding, landslides, and erosion, which have resulted in the loss of lives, homes, farmlands, properties, and roads, among other adverse consequences (Agwu and Okhimamhe, 2009). Figure 1 Figure 1. Map of southeast Nigeria. Source: Macmillian Atlas Series 2009. The population for the study comprised all farmers and relevant stakeholders operating in difficult-to-reach communities in the study region. Respondents were selected using a multi-stage sampling procedure. In the first stage, the five states that make up the Southeast Nigeria were selected purposefully to have good spread and depth of data and local perspectives. In the second stage, three senatorial zones were randomly selected in each state, given a total of 15 senatorial zones. In the third stage, five representative lead-farmers each were randomly selected from each of the 15 senatorial zones, given a total of 75 farmers used for the study. Data were collected using a semi-structure interview schedule and focus group discussion based on the specific objectives. The reliability of the instrument was tested using the Cronbach Alpha coefficient for internal consistency. The instrument was validated by experts in the Department of Agricultural Extension, University of Nigeria, Nsukka. Personal data, such as age (in years), gender (male or female), marital status (single, married, divorced/separated, and widowed), education (number of years spent in school), farming experience (years), household size (number of persons currently in the household), household monthly income (naira), estimated annual earnings (naira), access to extension service (number of times in the past 1 year), membership to the social organization(s), and access to credit facilities, were collected. Sources of information on climate change were collected by asking respondents to tick “Yes” or “No” from a list of information sources. Data on the effective traditional adaptation practices used to cushion the effects of climate change were collected by providing a list of perceived traditional practices. Respondents were required to rate the effective adaptive practices on a four-point Likert-type scale of very effective (4), effective (3), a little effective (2) and not effective (1). A mean score (2.5) was obtained. Variables with a mean score ≥2.5 were regarded as effective practices. Information on possible reasons for using traditional approaches for climate change adaptation were obtained by providing a list of variables for the respondents. Respondents were asked to rank the importance of traditional practices to their climate adaptation from a list of practices on a 3-point Likert scale of very important (3), important (2) and not important (1). A mean score (2) was obtained and all the variables with mean score ≥2 were regarded as important to adaptive capacity. Data on constraints to adaptation and mitigation were collected by asking the respondents to rank their constraints on a 3-point Likert scale of major constraint (2), minor constraint (1), not a constraint (0)—with a mean score of one. Data on the effectiveness of the strategies to mitigate the effect of climate change was measured by asking respondents to choose from a list of variables provided. Their responses were captured on a four-point Likert-type scale of very effective (4), effective (3), little effective (2), and not effective (1). A mean score (2.5) was obtained. Responses with a mean score ≥2.5 were regarded as effective. Excerpts from semi structure interviews and focus group discussions were reported in the result section of the article. Data obtained were analyzed with descriptive statistics (percentages, mean, and standard deviation) and principal component analysis using Varimax rotated factors analysis—through the IBM SPSS Statistics version 21 software. 3 Results 3.1 Socioeconomic characteristics of the farmers According to Table 1, results reveal that 52.0% of the respondents were female, while 48.0% were male. Regarding age distribution, most respondents (28.0%) fell within the 31–40 age range. Approximately 24.0% were aged between 41 and 50, 20.0% were 60 and above, and 18.7% were 30 and below. Only 9.3% were between 51 and 60 years old. The mean age of the farmers was 46.11, suggesting the active participation of middle-aged individuals in traditional agriculture. Regarding household size, a significant proportion (72.0%) of respondents had a household size of 5–8 persons, while 12.0% had 1–4 persons, and 16.0% had 8 or more persons. The results also indicate that the mean monthly household income was ₦20,093.33. Table 1 Table 1. Socioeconomic characteristics of the respondents (n = 75). 3.2 Sources of information by farmers on climate change adaptation The results in Table 2 indicate that most (76.0%) respondents obtain information on climate change, adaptation, and mitigation through face-to-face discussions with neighbors. This implies that community-based community approaches could be highly effective in disseminating information about climate change. Leveraging indigenous communication channels such as implementing community meetings or local discussion groups could be a strategic way to spread awareness and knowledge on climate adaptation and mitigation measures. Additionally, 66.7% of the respondents acquired information from fellow farmers. This implies that farmers probably trust and value the experiences and knowledge of their peers. Programs that engage local farmers as educators or facilitators could leverage this trust and peer influence for effective communication on climate resilience building. The reliance on radio by more than half 54.7% of respondents highlights its importance as a traditional but still relevant medium, especially in areas where digital connectivity might be limited. Radio programs focused on climate change, featuring expert advice, success stories from other farmers, and practical tips for adaptation and mitigation, could be a very effective outreach tool. Other information sources include videos (29.3%), newsletters on climate change (22.7%), internet (21.3%), television (20.0%), and among others. The variety of climate change information sources used by farmers underscores the need for a multi-channel communication strategy—since informal channels (neighbors and fellow farmers) could brood risk of misinformation or incomplete information being circulated. Table 2 Table 2. Source of information of farmers on climate changes (n = 75). 3.3 Effective traditional adaptation practices farmers use to cushion the effect of climate change In Table 3 show the traditional adaptation practices farmers use to cushion the effect of climate change. The traditional adaptation practices used include use of organic manure (x¯ = 3.89), traditional organic composting (x¯ = 3.80), afforestation (x¯ = 3.71), agroforestry (x¯ = 3.61), crop rotation (x¯ = 3.40), and mulching (x¯ = 3.37). These practices not only help in adapting to climate change but also contribute to mitigating its effects by enhancing carbon sequestration and biodiversity. For instance, the use of organic manure by the study participants is due to their accessibility, cost-effectiveness, or perceived effectiveness in improving soil health and resilience against climate variability. Excerpts from the focus group discussion indicate that farmers unanimously agree that [“…they use organic manure due to their accessibility, cost-effectiveness, or perceived effectiveness in improving soil health and resilience against climate variability…”]. Hence, these practices indicate a level of knowledge and adaptation to local climatic conditions. Table 3 Table 3. Traditional adaptation practices farmers use to cushion the effect of climate change (n = 75). Other traditional adaptation practices include intercropping (x¯ = 3.36), planting of cover crops and irrigation (x¯ = 3.29), integrated crop-animal farming (x¯ = 3.21), bush fallow practices (x¯ = 3.13), and among others. The use of intercropping and integrated crop-animal farming implies that indigenous people and communities prioritizes diversification as a key risk management strategy against the backdrop of climate change. Additionally, the use of irrigation, bush fallowing and covering crops indicates an awareness of and response to the need for optimal resource utilization, maintenance of soil health and sustainability, which is crucial for long-term agricultural productivity in the face of climate change. 3.4 Possible reasons for using traditional approaches to climate change adaptation Table 4 presents the key reasons for using traditional approaches to climate change adaptation. The reasons identified include increased soil fertility (x¯ = 2.95), aeration of soil (x¯ = 2.85), reduction of soil erosion (x¯ = 2.73), increase in soil moisture (x¯ = 2.03), enhancement of soil structure and aggregation (x¯ = 2.79), promotion of mineralization of nitrogen-containing compounds in the soil through the use of leguminous crops (x¯ = 2.68), reduction of nutrient loss from the soil (x¯ = 2.73), reduction of chemical pollution in the soil (x¯ = 2.33), and enhancement of agro-biodiversity through intercropping of legumes (x¯ = 2.56). This implies that farmers are aware of the importance of soil health in sustainable farming and climate change adaptation. This reflects a desire to maintain sustainable, eco-friendly farming practices that not only benefit the current crop but also contribute to the long-term health of the farm ecosystem. The reliance on traditional methods to deliver these benefits indicates a strong base of traditional agricultural knowledge and practices well-suited to local environmental conditions that have been passed down through generations. While these traditional practices are beneficial, there is potential for enhancing their effectiveness through the integration of scientific research and modern agricultural techniques. Table 4 Table 4. Possible reasons for using traditional approaches to climate change adaptation. 3.5 Constraints to adapting traditional agriculture to climate change Table 5 presents the constraints identified by the respondents to the use of traditional adaptation strategies. The major constraints to adaptation include climate variation leading to drought and high cost of accessing weather information (x¯ = 1.93), and inadequate funding (x¯ = 1.92). Access to micro-climate cues and finances are crucial in building local adaptation strategies. High cost of accessing reliable weather information frustrates traditional adaptive measures, making it difficult for farmers to plan and make informed climate-smart decisions effectively. It is therefore imperative to provide a more accessible, affordable, and accurate weather forecasting services tailored for farmers alongside financial assistance programs, subsidies, or microfinance solutions targeted at smallholder farmers. Participants also indicated that lack of technical knowledge and know-how (x¯ = 1.89) pose a major challenge to adapt. Mrs. Ngozika, a rural farmer from the study participant stated thus [“…I do not know the practical steps I could take to improve my farm activities in this era of climate change…”]. This implies a gap in the knowledge and skills necessary to implement effective adaptation strategies, which could probably be due to inadequate extension services or training programs. Inadequate infrastructure (x¯ = 1.87), such as roads and storage facilities, limits the ability of farmers to adapt to and mitigate the impacts of climate change. There is a need for governmental and non-governmental bodies to invest in rural infrastructure to support agricultural activities. Also, inadequate access to climate change information (x¯ = 1.85) present a formidable obstacle to rural adaptive capacities. This aligns with the high cost of accessing weather information and highlights a broader issue of information accessibility. Vulnerability to pests and diseases (x¯ = 1.83) resulting from climate change bedevils farmers adaptation efforts. Therefore, research into and promotion of climate-resilient crop varieties and integrated pest management practices are crucial for traditional agricultural systems. Other constraints faced by farmers include inadequate credit facilities (x¯ = 1.79), poor agricultural program and service delivery (x¯ = 1.69), high economic losses from farming (x¯ = 1.65), among others. Table 5 Table 5. Constraints to adaptation. Table 6 presents the results of the factor analysis of the constraints to adaptation. The variables with a loading of 0.4 score and above were included in naming the factors. Variables that loaded in more than one factor or had loadings below 0.4 were not used. Two key factors were identified and named: a technical problem (Factor 1) and a climate information problem (Factor 2). Under the technical problem (Factor 1), the major constraints identified by farmers include poor agricultural program and service delivery (loading = 0.768), high cost of farm operations (loading = 0.663), lack of skilled laboratory facilities for farm practices (loading = 0.650), inconsistent government policies (loading = 0.580), lack of extension services for providing information to farmers (loading = 0.539), high economic losses from farming (loading = 0.500), and vulnerability to pests and diseases (loading = 0.487). In Factor 2, the climate informational problem includes the high cost of accessing weather information (loading = 0.692) and drought climate variation (loading = 0.515). The factor analysis provides a clear framework for understanding the complex array of challenges in agricultural adaptation, emphasizing the need for comprehensive, well-coordinated responses that address both immediate technical issues and longer-term climate information accessibility challenges. Table 6 Table 6. Varimax rotated factors on constraints to adaptation. 3.6 Possible strategies to adapt and mitigate the effect of climate change Table 7 presents the respondents' responses regarding adopting respective mitigation measures. The major strategies adopted by farmers include the use of organic manure (x¯ = 3.87), use of resistant crops (score x¯ = 3.85), use of drought-resistant crops (x¯ = 3.68), and use of flood-tolerant crops (x¯ = 3.73). Farmers can adopt resistant crop varieties that are better suited to withstand the impacts of climate change, such as drought, extreme temperatures, and pests. Also, afforestation (planting trees; x¯ = 3.67), and use of use of cover crops (x¯ = 3.47) are important strategies to adapt and mitigate the effect of climate change. Excerpts from the focus group discussion indicate that farmers unanimously agree that [“…Planting palm, orange, and gmelina help remove climate pollutants from the atmosphere, contribute to climate change mitigation and provide additional benefits such as soil conservation and biodiversity enhancement…”]. Furthermore, the participant indicated access to reliable weather forecasting services (x¯ = 3.86) could help farmers make informed decisions and adapt their farming practices to changing climate conditions, thereby mitigating risks associated with irregular rainfall patterns. Famers also indicated that climate-smart agriculture practices (x¯ = 3.93) are important adaptation strategies. Implementing climate-smart agricultural practices, such as conservation tillage, diversified crop rotations, and rotational grazing, could effectively mitigate climate change impacts by sequestering carbon and enhancing soil health. Table 7 Table 7. Possible strategies to adopt and mitigate the effect of climate change (n = 75). Other important strategies identified by the respondents include incorporation of residues into the soil (x¯ = 3.23), proper conservation of seeds (x¯ = 3.75), provision of adequate mulching materials (x¯ = 3.40), among others. These strategies align with the principles of climate-resilient agriculture, which aims to enhance the adaptive capacity of agricultural systems and reduce their vulnerability to climate change while contributing to climate change mitigation. Table 8 shows the Varimax rotated factors of possible strategies to adopt and mitigate the effect of climate change. Variables that had loadings of 0.4 and above being included in naming the factors. Variables that loaded in more than one factor or had loadings below 0.4 were not used. Two factors were identified and named: agronomic methods (Factor 1) and research methods (Factor 2). Under the agronomic methods (Factor 1), the major strategies identified by farmers include changing the timing of farm operations (loading = 0.777), availability of extension service delivery (loading = 0.774), incorporation of residues into the soil (loading = 0.738), provision of adequate mulching materials (loading = 0.674), provision of infrastructure (loading = 0.550), use of resistant crops (loading = 0.535), and afforestation (loading = 0.414). In Factor 2, the research methods, the strategies identified are proper conservation of seeds (loading = 0.580), provision of adequate farm input supplies (loading = 0.437), and increased investment in agricultural research and development (loading = 0.424). Table 8 Table 8. Varimax rotated factors of possible strategies to adopt and mitigate the effect of climate change. 4 Discussion 4.1 Demographic characteristics of the farmers The United Nations reports that households in three Sub-Saharan African countries have an average of over 6 members each. Senegal stands out with one of the largest household sizes in Africa, averaging 10.8 members (United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division, 2019). These significant household sizes in Sub-Saharan Africa contribute to a valuable pool of labor for agricultural activities. The substantial household sizes in sub-Saharan Africa serve as a valuable labor reservoir for agricultural activities. Mr. Ode, a rural farmer said […I cannot afford machineries hence I use local labor, often involving family and friends…]. Compared to other regions such as North America and Europe, sub-Saharan Africa has larger average household size of 6.9 (Galal, 2023; Pew Research Center, 2023). This aligns with the result of this study of a mean household size of 6.43 people, indicating the families are relatively large and can contribute as a source of labor for farming activities. Thereby giving room for farming household to spend their extra income on other adaptive expenses. The empirical evidence from Swaziland underscored that sub-Saharan African countries could bear the brunt of climate change in terms of increased incidence of poverty and economic decline, with potential impacts on household welfare (Sam et al., 2021). The decrease in agricultural production due to the effects of climate change is a key contributing factor to farmers' reduced income. Findings showed that farmers have relatively low-income, indicating their reliance on income generated from the sales of their agricultural produce. This aligns firmly with related studies from sub-Saharan Africa (Ayanlade et al., 2018; Steinert et al., 2018; Ogada et al., 2020; Nwonu et al., 2022), which indicated that farmers within the region rely on personal savings. Farming experience is crucial to building climate resilience in traditional farming systems. Findings show that farmers have an average farming experience of 21.88 years, this implies that farmers in sub-Saharan Africa possess considerable experience addressing climate change issues in their farming practices, including adaptation and mitigation strategies (Sani and Chalchisa, 2016). However, support from governments and other organizations is crucial to enhance farmers' adaptation capacity and improve their access to resources and information. 4.2 Sources of information by farmers on climate change adaptation Smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa heavily rely on the environment for their livelihoods, making climate change adaptation crucial for their resilience. To achieve this, timely information on climate change adaptation strategies is vital. Although, there is limited information on the trend in climate information sources in sub-Saharan Africa. However, a study on smallholder farmers' climate resilience in Malawi and Ghana suggests that the relevance of information sources on climate change resilience is place-specific, and some sources may impede resilience (Amoak et al., 2023). Findings from the present study showed that across various survey regions, the main avenues through which individuals access information about climate change prominently include radio broadcasts, interactions with fellow farmers, and in-person discussions with neighbors. This widespread pattern of information dissemination aligns with the findings of multiple studies conducted not only in Anambra, as highlighted by Nwabugwu et al. (2019) and Uzochukwu et al. (2021), but also in diverse sub-Saharan African contexts. One of the noteworthy aspects of this information-sharing framework is the pivotal role of radio as a powerful and accessible medium for effectively communicating climate-related knowledge to diverse target groups across the region. According to and Antwi-Agyei et al. (2021) radio has proven to be a versatile tool in disseminating climate change information to both rural and urban communities, bridging information gaps, and promoting awareness and understanding of climate-related challenges. Additionally, community radio stations have been recognized for their ability to reach huge audiences and disseminate location-specific weather reporting, making them an effective tool for sharing climate information (Harvey et al., 2019; Global Center on Adaptation, 2023). This underscores the significance of radio as a primary and trusted source of climate-related information in sub-Saharan Africa. In addition to radio, the significance of peer interactions, particularly with fellow farmers and neighboring community members, emerges as a vital information source in the present study. A study on farmers' social networks and regional spillover effects in agricultural climate change mitigation emphasizes the positive influence of peer interactions on farmers' uptake of climate change adaptation measures (Kreft et al., 2023). Furthermore, a systematic review of smallholder farmers' climate change adaptation in sub-Saharan African indicated that knowledge integration and sharing within farming communities is important for adaptation to climate change (Jellason et al., 2022). This interpersonal exchange of knowledge within farming communities fosters the sharing of practical experiences, locally relevant adaptation strategies, and mitigation measures. Farmers can learn from one another's successes and challenges, making peer interactions a crucial component of climate change education and resilience-building efforts. It is important to acknowledge that while these channels are prevalent, there are variations in their prominence and effectiveness across sub-Saharan Africa's diverse regions and cultural contexts. 4.3 Effective traditional adaptation practices farmers use to cushion the effect of climate change Traditional adaptation practices are crucial for enhancing the climate change resilience of smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa. Findings show that all the tested traditional practices have high adoption rates as farmers utilize them to mitigate and adapt to climate change to minimize its effects. This aligns with the findings of the Crace (2019), which revealed that rural farmers have developed various strategies to reduce the impact of climate change, and these strategies have been tested and proven effective, reflecting farmers' perceptions and serving as effective mitigation and adaptation strategies. The increased application of organic manure by farmers serves multiple purposes, including enhancing soil fertility sustainably and increasing soil moisture content. Farmers noted that with rising temperatures and increased evapotranspiration caused by climate change, preserving moisture for crop use is crucial, making organic manure, planting of cover crops, bush fallow and mulching preferred options. They also emphasized that organic manure is cost-effective and readily available compared to inorganic fertilizers. This aligns with the findings of Quarshie et al. (2023) that traditional agricultural practitioners in sub-Saharan Africa implement on-farm adaptation options such as water management, and soil conservation techniques to combat climate change. Results showed that farmers deployed crop rotation, mixed cropping, intercropping, integrated crop-animal irrigation practices and shifting cultivation as key traditional soil and water management practices to adapt food crop production to climate change (Olumba et al., 2020; Benhin, 2021). This aligns with the findings of Naazie et al. (2023) who found that rural farmers in Ghana use crop diversification, intercropping, mixed farming and the adoption of improved crop varieties to adapt their agricultural production to climate change. Afforestation and agroforestry are important practices for promoting sustainable land use and mitigating the effects of climate change in sub-Saharan Africa. Results from the present study showed that farmers used afforestation and agroforestry techniques as an effective adaptation strategy as opposed mitigation strategy. These offers one of the most promising technological options for reversing soil degradation, restoring tree cover, and improving agricultural productivity in Africa. Famers reported the key agroforestry practices that helped them to adapt their agricultural system to climate change to include grazing or farming under savanna trees, growing coffee or cocoa under shade trees, planting fruit trees, sowing tree seeds on fallow land to speed up the restoration of fertility, planting “living” fences, windbreaks, or woodlots, combining trees, shrubs, and field crops in multistoried cropping systems, and growing crops between rows of nitrogen-fixing trees or shrubs (“alley cropping”). On the other hand, farmers also reported their engagement in tree planting campaigns in areas where there was no forest cover previously. In sub-Saharan Africa, afforestation programs have been implemented to combat deforestation and land degradation (Chomba et al., 2020). This is an effective traditional way of increasing soil cover, sequester carbon and mitigate the effects of climate change on rural agriculture. 4.4 Possible reasons for using traditional approaches to climate change adaptation Sub-Saharan African countries are incorporating traditional approaches to climate change adaptation due to their effectiveness and relevance to local conditions. Findings indicate that adopting traditional agricultural practices for climate change adaptation delivers multi-faceted benefits including enhancing soil quality and crop productivity by altering soil structure, promoting nutrient cycling, and reducing pests and diseases. Peoples and Baldock (2020) reported that crop rotation can increase the production of subsequent crops. Niggli et al. (2019) also stated that organic matter enhances soil resistance to drought and makes them adaptable to low and high rainfall conditions. Famers reported that improving over soil health, soil organic matter and crop yield, reducing greenhouse gas emission and enhancing resilience against climate variability are the major reasons why they use traditional approaches such as use of organic manure, traditional organic composting, afforestation and agroforestry, among others. The utilization of these techniques highlights the importance of diversifying agricultural practices to enhance climate resilience, which can serve as a model for other regions grappling with similar challenges. For instance, the successful implementation of afforestation and agroforestry initiatives in Southeast Nigeria as a means of enhancing the productivity of farming business demonstrates their potential as nature-based solutions to climate change that can be scaled up in similar agro-ecosystems. As climate change continues to pose challenges to agricultural systems across the continent, sharing and scaling up these effective practices can contribute significantly to building climate-resilient farming communities and ensuring food security for future generations in sub-Saharan Africa. 4.5 Constraints to adapting traditional agriculture to climate change Smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa face multifaceted challenges as they seek to adapt traditional agriculture to climate change. Lead farmers in the present study reported that poor agricultural extension services, pest and disease vulnerability, and inadequate dissemination of climate change information due to limited extension services are factors that hinder climate change adaptation, which corroborates the research conducted by Satishkumar et al. (2020). Studies in Nigeria and Ghana have highlighted constraints such as inadequate finance, scarcity of labor, inadequate access to climate information, and lack of access to weather information as significant barriers to farmers' efforts to adapt to climate change (Abegunde et al., 2019; Ige et al., 2021). Additionally, unpredictable weather conditions have been identified as a serious constraint to climate change adaptation strategies in Northern Ghana, affecting arable crop farmers' choice of adaptation strategies (Ige et al., 2021). On the other hand, findings showed that farmers do not have the knowledge to determine the level of accuracy of their climate information, because they never had real-time access to climate information. However, Fagariba et al. (2018) suggested that the inadequacy, inaccuracy, and inconsistency of climatic information available to farmers pose constraints in weather forecasting as an adaptation strategy to climate change. Furthermore, the high cost of accessing weather forecast information and its incompatibility with farmers' needs also hampers the adoption of weather forecasting as a reliable means of coping with the effects of climate change (Ojo et al., 2018). The result of the factor analysis resolved the constraints encountered by farmers into two components namely technical production and climate information problems. This is in tandem with the findings of Autio et al. (2021) who found that smallholder farmers in Southeast Kenya face challenges in adopting climate-smart agricultural practices due to limited access to productive resources and climate uncertainty. This is probably because formal climate adaptation strategies in sub-Saharan Africa often fail to consider the agency of smallholder farmers, leading to a disconnect between the strategies and the farmers' actual adaptation practices and needs. Addressing these constraints is crucial for the successful implementation of climate-smart agricultural practices and the resilience of agricultural systems in the region. 4.6 Possible strategies to adapt and mitigate the effect of climate change in traditional agricultural systems Climate change poses significant challenges to traditional agricultural systems in sub-Saharan Africa. Smallholder farmers in the region have been adapting to a changing climate, but there is a need for more comprehensive strategies to mitigate its effects. Farmers in the study area indicated that the use of climate-smart agriculture, the use of resistant crop varieties, afforestation, and other identified strategies can effectively mitigate the effects of climate change. This finding aligns with the research conducted by Ali et al. (2019), who highlighted the importance of using resistant crop varieties to adapt and build resilience to the effects of climate change. Resistant crops are known to survive and complete their life cycles even in adverse environmental conditions, providing a useful adaptation strategy (Barasa et al., 2021). Similarly, Jellason et al. (2022) indicated that on-farm adaptation options, agro-ecological intensification (AEI) practices, diversification and intercropping, adoption of improved crop varieties and soil and water management practices are crucial adaptation strategies to climate change in sub-Saharan Africa dry lands. The results further demonstrate that farmers have developed and tested various strategies to reduce the effects of climate change. This highlights their proactive approach to adopting measures to mitigate climate change and their ability to innovate and adapt to the changing environment. The results from the factor analysis categorized the strategies adopted by farmers into two categories namely agronomic methods and research methods for adaptation. Farmers indicated that adjusting the timing of farm operations, availability of extension services, incorporating crop residues into the soil, provision of mulching materials, infrastructure, and adoption of resistant crops and afforestation, are vital agronomic strategies to adapt traditional agriculture to climate change. In terms of the research methods to adaptations, farmers highlight the importance of proper seed conservation, availability of adequate farm inputs, and increased investment in agricultural research and development as crucial aspects to address in enhancing the resilience of their agricultural systems to climate change. 5 Conclusion This study provides valuable insights into the socioeconomic characteristics of farmers and their practices in adapting to climate change. The findings highlight the significant role of women in rural areas and their involvement in sustainable agriculture practices, as evidenced by a higher percentage of female respondents. The large household size and relatively low-income levels underscore the importance of agriculture as a primary source of livelihood for these farmers. Farmers have considerable experience addressing climate change issues, indicating their potential to collaborate and implement effective adaptation and mitigation strategies. However, the study also reveals the reliance on limited sources of climate change information, such as radio and fellow farmers, indicating the need for improved dissemination channels and access to diverse sources of knowledge. The study highlights the prevalent use of climate-smart traditional agricultural practices among indigenous people, including organic manure application and mixed farming, demonstrating farmers' proactive approach to mitigating the effects of climate change. These practices enhance soil fertility and moisture retention and improve crop productivity and resilience. Nevertheless, the study identifies constraints such as poor extension services, limited access to climate information, and technical challenges that hinder effective adaptation. These constraints require enhanced support systems, policy interventions, and agricultural research and development investments. In light of the findings, promoting climate-smart agriculture, the use of resistant crop varieties, afforestation, and sustainable farming practices emerge as essential strategies to mitigate the effects of climate change. By addressing the identified constraints and building upon farmers' existing knowledge and experiences, we can enhance their resilience, improve agricultural productivity, and contribute to sustainable rural development. 5.1 Policy implications of the findings • Strengthen extension services and diversify information sources: Governments should invest in and strengthen extension services to provide farmers with up-to-date climate change information, area-specific weather cues, agricultural best practices, and new technologies. And promote the use of diverse information sources, including indigenous channels, digital platforms and community-based knowledge sharing. • Promote climate-smart agricultural practices: Encourage the adoption of climate-smart agricultural practices through incentives, subsidies, and training programs. Governments should support research and development in climate-resilient crop varieties and livestock breeds. • Increase investment in agricultural research: Allocate more funding to agricultural research and innovation to develop climate-resilient technologies, improved crop varieties, and sustainable farming practices. • Access to credit for climate-resilient infrastructure: Facilitate access to credit and financial services for farmers to invest in climate-resilient infrastructure, such as irrigation systems, drought-resistant seeds, and storage facilities. • Supportive policies and collaborative networks: Create a conducive policy environment that encourages sustainable agricultural practices and promotes collaboration among various stakeholders, including government agencies, NGOs, and research institutions. • Capacity-Building Workshops and Progress Monitoring: Organize capacity-building workshops and training programs for farmers, extension workers, and other stakeholders to enhance their knowledge and skills in climate adaptation and mitigation. And also implement regular progress monitoring and evaluation to assess the effectiveness of climate adaptation efforts. • Enabling Environment for Continuous Learning and Improvement: Foster an environment that promotes continuous learning and improvement in agricultural practices. Encourage farmers to experiment with new techniques and technologies while providing them with the necessary support and resources. • Collaboration among policymakers, researchers, and local communities: Promote collaboration and coordination among policymakers, researchers, and local communities to ensure that climate-resilient and sustainable agricultural practices are developed, disseminated, and adopted effectively.

Mbah3 1Department of Sustainability in Agriculture, Food Production and Food Technology, Hungarian University of Agricultural and Life Sciences, Godollo, Hungary 2Department of Agricultural Extension, University of Nigeria, Nsukka, Nigeria 3Department of Animal Science, University of Nigeria, Nsukka, Nigeria Introduction: Sub-Saharan Africa faces increasingly unpredictable and extreme weather patterns due to climate change, posing significant threats to food security and rural livelihoods. Traditional agriculture, deeply rooted in the region's history and culture, is particularly vulnerable to these changes. This study investigates the adaptation strategies of traditional agricultural farmers to climate change using southeast Nigeria as a microcosm of the broader challenges facing sub-Saharan Africa. Methods: Multistage sampling procedure was used to select 75 farmer group leaders in the study region. Cross-sectional data were collected through semi-structured interview schedules and focus group discussions. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and principal component analysis using Varimax rotated matrix. Results: Findings showed that farmers rely on face-to-face discussions with neighbors (76.0%), fellow farmers (66.7%), and radio (54.7%) as their primary sources of information on climate change. Results showed that traditional adaptation practices such as use of organic manure (x¯ = 3.89), traditional organic composting (x¯ = 3.80), afforestation (x¯ = 3.71), agroforestry (x¯ = 3.61) were the topmost traditional agricultural practices use to cushion the effect of climate change. Conserving the overall soil health, soil moisture retention, reducing CO2 emissions and maintaining crop productivity were the major reasons for using the traditional approaches. Climate-induced drought and high cost of accessing weather information (x¯ = 1.93), and inadequate funding (x¯ = 1.92), among others were the key constraints to adaptation. Discussion: Results showed that farmers prioritize agronomic manipulation and integrated research approaches as key strategies to adapting traditional agriculture to climate anomalies. Although farmers used their indigenous practices, continuous learning and improvement through capacity-building workshops and progress monitoring are essential for effective climate change adaptation. Policymakers should invest in promoting indigenous knowledge, provide access to credit for climate-resilient infrastructure, promote climate-smart agricultural practices and foster collaborative research as the cornerstone for sustainable rural development. 1 Introduction Sub-Saharan Africa, a vast and diverse region characterized by its rich cultural heritage and ecological variety, has long been recognized as a crucial battleground in the fight against climate change and its devastating consequences (Thompson et al., 2010). The region is particularly vulnerable to climate change, with multiple biophysical, political, and socioeconomic stresses interacting to affect rural communities, where agriculture is a major lifeline. Studies consistently predict decreased crop productivity, land degradation, high market prices, and negative impacts on livelihoods, exacerbating food insecurity in the region (Emediegwu et al., 2022; Oyelami et al., 2023). Climate change is intensifying food insecurity across sub-Saharan Africa, and leading to changes in yield and area growth, higher food prices, reduced calorie availability, and growing childhood malnutrition (Ringler et al., 2010). Salgado Baptista et al. (2022) projected the crop yield, especially in key staples, in the region to decline by 5–17% by 2050 due to rising temperatures and rainfall volatility. Successive weather shocks, such as droughts and floods, significantly raise food insecurity, particularly in countries where agricultural productivity is already below the global average (Salgado Baptista et al., 2022). With a predominantly agrarian economy dominated by stallholder farmers and a heavy reliance on traditional agricultural practices rooted in centuries of local knowledge and practices, the nations of sub-Saharan Africa are acutely vulnerable to the adverse impacts of a changing climate. Nigeria, as the most populous country in Africa, serves as a microcosm of the broader challenges and opportunities facing sub-Saharan Africa. It plays a pivotal role in the region's agricultural landscape and is emblematic of the broader climate adaptation issues faced by many nations in sub-Saharan Africa. Nigeria is estimated to contribute 14% of Africa's agriculture GDP, making it one of the top three African countries with the highest GDP contribution from agriculture (Oyaniran and Omomia, 2018). Between January and March 2021, agriculture contributed to 22.35% of Nigeria's GDP, with over 140 million Nigerians engaged in the sector mainly at a subsistence level. On formal level, more than 36% (above 28.9 million) of Nigeria's labor force was employed in agriculture, with over 80% of the agricultural workforce being smallholder farmers (FAO, 2019; Mayong et al., 2021; International Trade Administration, 2023). Nigeria possesses an abundance of arable land and a favorable climate to produce various crops, including maize, cassava, guinea corn, yam, beans, millet, and rice (FAO, 2019). However, despite its significant contribution to the economy, Nigeria's agricultural sector faces formidable challenges such as climate change and climate-induced socio-economic stressors. These challenges have stifled agricultural productivity, affecting the sector's contribution to the country's GDP and leading to increased food imports due to population growth (FAO, 2019). The impacts of climate change in Nigeria are characterized by increasing climate variability, leading to more intense and untimely rainfall, land degradation, flash floods, landslides, and gully erosion (Ghosh, 2019; World Bank, 2022). By 2009, an estimated 6,000 gullies were destroying infrastructure, farmland, and real estate across rural and urban Nigeria, causing fear and despair among the population (World Bank, 2022). The climate change-induced losses and unsustainable use of resources have elevated themselves to a real development challenge in Nigeria, particularly along the coastal states in the south and the northern frontline states, thwarting the age-old rhythms of traditional agriculture which are rooted in centuries of local knowledge and practices. The negative impacts of climate change on Nigeria's agriculture have been observed predominantly in the northern, northeastern, southwestern and southeast regions, which experience extreme weather conditions (Tajudeen et al., 2022; World Bank, 2022). The loss of life and property due to sudden, unpredictable, and uncontrollable floods is a nightmare for many Nigerians, destroying crops, farms, lands, and houses. The agricultural sector, which is the country's economic mainstay, is also grappling with lower crop yields, food insecurity, deepening poverty, forced displacement, labor inefficiency due to high temperatures and conflicts due to drought, flooding, sea level rise, erosion, and rapid decline in earth's limiting resources (Brouziyne et al., 2018; Obaji et al., 2022; United Nations Development Programme, 2023). In 2022 alone, climate-induced pests and diseases insurgence caused crop losses of up to 80% in some areas, impacting 1.5–200,000 hectares of land, and more than 20% of crops experienced post-harvest losses in several states (Adegwu, 2022). Major crops affected included maize, rice, sorghum, millet, soybean, groundnut, cowpea, root and tubers, fruits, vegetables, and tree crops in 33 states (Adegwu, 2022; Rizzo et al., 2023). The country's tropical climate is characterized by high temperatures, humidity, and rainfall, with larger amounts of rainfall experienced in the south and southeast regions of the country. Wind patterns are influenced by Nigeria's location and topography, largely due to the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) which brings moist winds from the Atlantic Ocean during the wet season and dry winds from the Sahara Desert during the dry season (Dia et al., 2023), which influences the annual temperature. The Nigeria temperature records indicate an average increase of 1.4–1.9°C, with predictions of further increases of 2–5°C by the end of the century if no decisive action is taken (Brouziyne et al., 2018). Nigeria is already experiencing the adverse effects of climate change, as with natural disasters are occurring more frequently and with greater intensity. These multi-dimensional adverse effects have not only hampered the ability of the agricultural sector to meet the country's food demands but have also disrupted the traditional roles of agriculture in Nigeria's economy, leading to a shift from being a net food exporter to an importer (Onyeneke et al., 2021). The cumulative agricultural imports of the country stood at N3.35 trillion between 2016 and 2019, which was four times higher than the agricultural export of N803 billion within the same period (FAO, 2019). Therefore, it is crucial to explore and implement interdisciplinary adaptation strategies that can enhance the sustainability and resilience of agri-food systems to climate anomalies. Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) has emerged as a competent response to the challenges posed by climate change on agriculture in rural areas. It entails the integration of traditional agricultural practices with modern techniques. Traditional agriculture, rooted in indigenous knowledge, cultural beliefs, and sustainable practices, offers valuable insights into adapting agricultural systems to a changing climate (Tsado, 2019). The approach of CSA is recognized for its potential to enhance farm productivity and incomes, adaptation, and resilience to climate change in rural African context (Abegunde and Obi, 2022). CSA offers a comprehensive strategy for addressing the interconnected challenges faced by smallholder farmers in African countries, focusing on three core goals: increasing agricultural productivity, adapting and building resilience to climate change, and developing opportunities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture (Obaji et al., 2022). Additionally, the FAO emphasizes that CSA is an approach that helps guide actions to transform agri-food systems toward green and climate-resilient practices, addressing challenges related to climate change and agriculture (FAO, 2023). However, CSA is not a one-size-fits-all approach and requires tailoring to specific climate risks faced by different farming communities, regions, and ecosystems. While CSA offers a solution to many of the secondary and tertiary problems caused by climate shocks, it is still not a familiar solution to climate adaptation and mitigation in last-mile communities. The effective utilization of CSA at grassroots is not just about understanding “how its works” but in appreciating the intricate web of cultural, economic, ecological, and technological factors that influence this adaptation tactics. Rural communities in sub-Saharan Africa are adapting their traditional agriculture to climate change through a variety of strategies and practices. Indigenous peoples and local communities are leveraging traditional knowledge and improved crop varieties to cope with extreme weather and environmental changes caused by climate change (Swiderska, 2011). Traditional agricultural practices, which have been developed over centuries, are proving to be valuable in building resilience and adapting to the impacts of climate change (Singh and Singh, 2017). Adjustments in planting dates, crop varieties, drainage systems, using advanced technologies and land management regimes to maintain yields and soil fertility (Arbuckle et al., 2015), are crucial on-the-ground strategies used by local farmers to counter the adverse effects of climatic changes. Traditional practices, such as agroforestry, intercropping, crop rotation, cover cropping, traditional organic composting, and integrated crop-animal farming, have demonstrated the potential to improve crop productivity and mitigate climate change impacts (Tripathi et al., 2019; Mashi et al., 2022). These practices, honed over thousands of years by indigenous farmers and local communities, provide valuable adaptation strategies in the face of climate uncertainties. Traditional agricultural practices have the potential to adapt and mitigate climate change through its unique agroecological features. They increase agrobiodiversity and resilience of agroecosystems, are low-cost, energy-efficient, and based on locally available resources (Singh and Singh, 2017). It is characterized by high productivity, biodiversity conservation, low energy inputs, and climate change mitigation (Singh and Singh, 2017). Therefore, integrating traditional knowledge into climate change policies is seen as a cost-effective, climate-smart approach and sustainable adaptation strategy to climate variability. While there is a growing recognition of the role of traditional knowledge in adapting agriculture to climate change, the role of indigenous knowledge and adaptive practices remains largely undervalued by decision-makers. Negotiating parties in international climate talks tend to focus on intensifying production through modern agriculture, overlooking the potential of traditional knowledge in adaptation (Swiderska, 2011). The unsustainable transition from traditional agriculture to modern methods in rural communities has led to the loss of crop genetic resources and environmental sustainability challenges, exacerbating the effects of climate change. Therefore, there is an urgent need to rediscover and re-implement traditional agricultural practices while integrating them with modern approaches to enhance the socio-ecological integrity of agroecosystems (Shittu et al., 2021). Ricart et al. (2023) analyzed a portfolio of 435 articles collected from WoS and Scopus databases between 2010 and 2020, finding that farmers are in a favorable position to offer first-hand observations and provide a deeper understanding of climate change manifestation, relevance, effects, and narratives. Therefore, farmers' knowledge provides a framework for appraising and incorporating new ideas, experiences, and information into existing systems (Haradhan, 2017). This study explored the adaptation strategies employed by farmers to mitigate the impacts of climate change on their indigenous agricultural system using southeast Nigeria as a model region for all riparian regions in sub-Saharan Africa. The specific objective of the study entails identifying the key climate change information sources by farmers; elicit the effective traditional adaptation practices farmers use to cushion the effect of climate change; examine the possible reasons for using traditional approaches to climate change adaptation, identify the constraints to adaptation, and the effective strategies to adapt and mitigate the effect of climate change. The grand objective of the study is to provide grassroots insights and recommendations for fostering sustainability and climate-resilient agri-food systems in sub-Saharan Africa. 2 Methodology The study was carried out in Southeast Nigeria, specifically within the geographical coordinates of latitudes 04° 17′N and 07° 06′N and longitudes 05° 23′E and 09° 28′E, as described in Macmillian's 2009 report. This region covers an area spanning 29,908 square kilometers and is inhabited by ~16,381,729 people, according to the Nigeria. National Bureau of Statistics (2007). It encompasses the territories of Abia state, Anambra state, Ebonyi state, Enugu state, and Imo state (see Figure 1). The climate of the Southeast can be broadly characterized as tropical, featuring distinct wet and dry seasons. It falls within the tropical belt, with early rainfall typically occurring in January/February and the full onset of the rainy season in March, concluding in November each year. The dry season typically lasts for 4–5 months, with the highest rainfall occurring from July to October, with a slight respite in August. On average, the region experiences an annual rainfall of ~1,952 mm, and the mean daily and annual temperatures are around 28 and 27°C, respectively (Igbokwe et al., 2008). Southeast Nigeria is primarily an agricultural area, with predominantly sandy and often loose and porous soil types. The most commonly cultivated crops in this region include cassava, rice, yam, cocoyam, maize, plantain/banana, cashew, oil palm, and coconut. Additionally, the major livestock raised in the area consist of goats, sheep, and poultry. In the southeastern region, the effects of climate change are readily noticeable, manifested in increased instances of flooding, landslides, and erosion, which have resulted in the loss of lives, homes, farmlands, properties, and roads, among other adverse consequences (Agwu and Okhimamhe, 2009). Figure 1 Figure 1. Map of southeast Nigeria. Source: Macmillian Atlas Series 2009. The population for the study comprised all farmers and relevant stakeholders operating in difficult-to-reach communities in the study region. Respondents were selected using a multi-stage sampling procedure. In the first stage, the five states that make up the Southeast Nigeria were selected purposefully to have good spread and depth of data and local perspectives. In the second stage, three senatorial zones were randomly selected in each state, given a total of 15 senatorial zones. In the third stage, five representative lead-farmers each were randomly selected from each of the 15 senatorial zones, given a total of 75 farmers used for the study. Data were collected using a semi-structure interview schedule and focus group discussion based on the specific objectives. The reliability of the instrument was tested using the Cronbach Alpha coefficient for internal consistency. The instrument was validated by experts in the Department of Agricultural Extension, University of Nigeria, Nsukka. Personal data, such as age (in years), gender (male or female), marital status (single, married, divorced/separated, and widowed), education (number of years spent in school), farming experience (years), household size (number of persons currently in the household), household monthly income (naira), estimated annual earnings (naira), access to extension service (number of times in the past 1 year), membership to the social organization(s), and access to credit facilities, were collected. Sources of information on climate change were collected by asking respondents to tick “Yes” or “No” from a list of information sources. Data on the effective traditional adaptation practices used to cushion the effects of climate change were collected by providing a list of perceived traditional practices. Respondents were required to rate the effective adaptive practices on a four-point Likert-type scale of very effective (4), effective (3), a little effective (2) and not effective (1). A mean score (2.5) was obtained. Variables with a mean score ≥2.5 were regarded as effective practices. Information on possible reasons for using traditional approaches for climate change adaptation were obtained by providing a list of variables for the respondents. Respondents were asked to rank the importance of traditional practices to their climate adaptation from a list of practices on a 3-point Likert scale of very important (3), important (2) and not important (1). A mean score (2) was obtained and all the variables with mean score ≥2 were regarded as important to adaptive capacity. Data on constraints to adaptation and mitigation were collected by asking the respondents to rank their constraints on a 3-point Likert scale of major constraint (2), minor constraint (1), not a constraint (0)—with a mean score of one. Data on the effectiveness of the strategies to mitigate the effect of climate change was measured by asking respondents to choose from a list of variables provided. Their responses were captured on a four-point Likert-type scale of very effective (4), effective (3), little effective (2), and not effective (1). A mean score (2.5) was obtained. Responses with a mean score ≥2.5 were regarded as effective. Excerpts from semi structure interviews and focus group discussions were reported in the result section of the article. Data obtained were analyzed with descriptive statistics (percentages, mean, and standard deviation) and principal component analysis using Varimax rotated factors analysis—through the IBM SPSS Statistics version 21 software. 3 Results 3.1 Socioeconomic characteristics of the farmers According to Table 1, results reveal that 52.0% of the respondents were female, while 48.0% were male. Regarding age distribution, most respondents (28.0%) fell within the 31–40 age range. Approximately 24.0% were aged between 41 and 50, 20.0% were 60 and above, and 18.7% were 30 and below. Only 9.3% were between 51 and 60 years old. The mean age of the farmers was 46.11, suggesting the active participation of middle-aged individuals in traditional agriculture. Regarding household size, a significant proportion (72.0%) of respondents had a household size of 5–8 persons, while 12.0% had 1–4 persons, and 16.0% had 8 or more persons. The results also indicate that the mean monthly household income was ₦20,093.33. Table 1 Table 1. Socioeconomic characteristics of the respondents (n = 75). 3.2 Sources of information by farmers on climate change adaptation The results in Table 2 indicate that most (76.0%) respondents obtain information on climate change, adaptation, and mitigation through face-to-face discussions with neighbors. This implies that community-based community approaches could be highly effective in disseminating information about climate change. Leveraging indigenous communication channels such as implementing community meetings or local discussion groups could be a strategic way to spread awareness and knowledge on climate adaptation and mitigation measures. Additionally, 66.7% of the respondents acquired information from fellow farmers. This implies that farmers probably trust and value the experiences and knowledge of their peers. Programs that engage local farmers as educators or facilitators could leverage this trust and peer influence for effective communication on climate resilience building. The reliance on radio by more than half 54.7% of respondents highlights its importance as a traditional but still relevant medium, especially in areas where digital connectivity might be limited. Radio programs focused on climate change, featuring expert advice, success stories from other farmers, and practical tips for adaptation and mitigation, could be a very effective outreach tool. Other information sources include videos (29.3%), newsletters on climate change (22.7%), internet (21.3%), television (20.0%), and among others. The variety of climate change information sources used by farmers underscores the need for a multi-channel communication strategy—since informal channels (neighbors and fellow farmers) could brood risk of misinformation or incomplete information being circulated. Table 2 Table 2. Source of information of farmers on climate changes (n = 75). 3.3 Effective traditional adaptation practices farmers use to cushion the effect of climate change In Table 3 show the traditional adaptation practices farmers use to cushion the effect of climate change. The traditional adaptation practices used include use of organic manure (x¯ = 3.89), traditional organic composting (x¯ = 3.80), afforestation (x¯ = 3.71), agroforestry (x¯ = 3.61), crop rotation (x¯ = 3.40), and mulching (x¯ = 3.37). These practices not only help in adapting to climate change but also contribute to mitigating its effects by enhancing carbon sequestration and biodiversity. For instance, the use of organic manure by the study participants is due to their accessibility, cost-effectiveness, or perceived effectiveness in improving soil health and resilience against climate variability. Excerpts from the focus group discussion indicate that farmers unanimously agree that [“…they use organic manure due to their accessibility, cost-effectiveness, or perceived effectiveness in improving soil health and resilience against climate variability…”]. Hence, these practices indicate a level of knowledge and adaptation to local climatic conditions. Table 3 Table 3. Traditional adaptation practices farmers use to cushion the effect of climate change (n = 75). Other traditional adaptation practices include intercropping (x¯ = 3.36), planting of cover crops and irrigation (x¯ = 3.29), integrated crop-animal farming (x¯ = 3.21), bush fallow practices (x¯ = 3.13), and among others. The use of intercropping and integrated crop-animal farming implies that indigenous people and communities prioritizes diversification as a key risk management strategy against the backdrop of climate change. Additionally, the use of irrigation, bush fallowing and covering crops indicates an awareness of and response to the need for optimal resource utilization, maintenance of soil health and sustainability, which is crucial for long-term agricultural productivity in the face of climate change. 3.4 Possible reasons for using traditional approaches to climate change adaptation Table 4 presents the key reasons for using traditional approaches to climate change adaptation. The reasons identified include increased soil fertility (x¯ = 2.95), aeration of soil (x¯ = 2.85), reduction of soil erosion (x¯ = 2.73), increase in soil moisture (x¯ = 2.03), enhancement of soil structure and aggregation (x¯ = 2.79), promotion of mineralization of nitrogen-containing compounds in the soil through the use of leguminous crops (x¯ = 2.68), reduction of nutrient loss from the soil (x¯ = 2.73), reduction of chemical pollution in the soil (x¯ = 2.33), and enhancement of agro-biodiversity through intercropping of legumes (x¯ = 2.56). This implies that farmers are aware of the importance of soil health in sustainable farming and climate change adaptation. This reflects a desire to maintain sustainable, eco-friendly farming practices that not only benefit the current crop but also contribute to the long-term health of the farm ecosystem. The reliance on traditional methods to deliver these benefits indicates a strong base of traditional agricultural knowledge and practices well-suited to local environmental conditions that have been passed down through generations. While these traditional practices are beneficial, there is potential for enhancing their effectiveness through the integration of scientific research and modern agricultural techniques. Table 4 Table 4. Possible reasons for using traditional approaches to climate change adaptation. 3.5 Constraints to adapting traditional agriculture to climate change Table 5 presents the constraints identified by the respondents to the use of traditional adaptation strategies. The major constraints to adaptation include climate variation leading to drought and high cost of accessing weather information (x¯ = 1.93), and inadequate funding (x¯ = 1.92). Access to micro-climate cues and finances are crucial in building local adaptation strategies. High cost of accessing reliable weather information frustrates traditional adaptive measures, making it difficult for farmers to plan and make informed climate-smart decisions effectively. It is therefore imperative to provide a more accessible, affordable, and accurate weather forecasting services tailored for farmers alongside financial assistance programs, subsidies, or microfinance solutions targeted at smallholder farmers. Participants also indicated that lack of technical knowledge and know-how (x¯ = 1.89) pose a major challenge to adapt. Mrs. Ngozika, a rural farmer from the study participant stated thus [“…I do not know the practical steps I could take to improve my farm activities in this era of climate change…”]. This implies a gap in the knowledge and skills necessary to implement effective adaptation strategies, which could probably be due to inadequate extension services or training programs. Inadequate infrastructure (x¯ = 1.87), such as roads and storage facilities, limits the ability of farmers to adapt to and mitigate the impacts of climate change. There is a need for governmental and non-governmental bodies to invest in rural infrastructure to support agricultural activities. Also, inadequate access to climate change information (x¯ = 1.85) present a formidable obstacle to rural adaptive capacities. This aligns with the high cost of accessing weather information and highlights a broader issue of information accessibility. Vulnerability to pests and diseases (x¯ = 1.83) resulting from climate change bedevils farmers adaptation efforts. Therefore, research into and promotion of climate-resilient crop varieties and integrated pest management practices are crucial for traditional agricultural systems. Other constraints faced by farmers include inadequate credit facilities (x¯ = 1.79), poor agricultural program and service delivery (x¯ = 1.69), high economic losses from farming (x¯ = 1.65), among others. Table 5 Table 5. Constraints to adaptation. Table 6 presents the results of the factor analysis of the constraints to adaptation. The variables with a loading of 0.4 score and above were included in naming the factors. Variables that loaded in more than one factor or had loadings below 0.4 were not used. Two key factors were identified and named: a technical problem (Factor 1) and a climate information problem (Factor 2). Under the technical problem (Factor 1), the major constraints identified by farmers include poor agricultural program and service delivery (loading = 0.768), high cost of farm operations (loading = 0.663), lack of skilled laboratory facilities for farm practices (loading = 0.650), inconsistent government policies (loading = 0.580), lack of extension services for providing information to farmers (loading = 0.539), high economic losses from farming (loading = 0.500), and vulnerability to pests and diseases (loading = 0.487). In Factor 2, the climate informational problem includes the high cost of accessing weather information (loading = 0.692) and drought climate variation (loading = 0.515). The factor analysis provides a clear framework for understanding the complex array of challenges in agricultural adaptation, emphasizing the need for comprehensive, well-coordinated responses that address both immediate technical issues and longer-term climate information accessibility challenges. Table 6 Table 6. Varimax rotated factors on constraints to adaptation. 3.6 Possible strategies to adapt and mitigate the effect of climate change Table 7 presents the respondents' responses regarding adopting respective mitigation measures. The major strategies adopted by farmers include the use of organic manure (x¯ = 3.87), use of resistant crops (score x¯ = 3.85), use of drought-resistant crops (x¯ = 3.68), and use of flood-tolerant crops (x¯ = 3.73). Farmers can adopt resistant crop varieties that are better suited to withstand the impacts of climate change, such as drought, extreme temperatures, and pests. Also, afforestation (planting trees; x¯ = 3.67), and use of use of cover crops (x¯ = 3.47) are important strategies to adapt and mitigate the effect of climate change. Excerpts from the focus group discussion indicate that farmers unanimously agree that [“…Planting palm, orange, and gmelina help remove climate pollutants from the atmosphere, contribute to climate change mitigation and provide additional benefits such as soil conservation and biodiversity enhancement…”]. Furthermore, the participant indicated access to reliable weather forecasting services (x¯ = 3.86) could help farmers make informed decisions and adapt their farming practices to changing climate conditions, thereby mitigating risks associated with irregular rainfall patterns. Famers also indicated that climate-smart agriculture practices (x¯ = 3.93) are important adaptation strategies. Implementing climate-smart agricultural practices, such as conservation tillage, diversified crop rotations, and rotational grazing, could effectively mitigate climate change impacts by sequestering carbon and enhancing soil health. Table 7 Table 7. Possible strategies to adopt and mitigate the effect of climate change (n = 75). Other important strategies identified by the respondents include incorporation of residues into the soil (x¯ = 3.23), proper conservation of seeds (x¯ = 3.75), provision of adequate mulching materials (x¯ = 3.40), among others. These strategies align with the principles of climate-resilient agriculture, which aims to enhance the adaptive capacity of agricultural systems and reduce their vulnerability to climate change while contributing to climate change mitigation. Table 8 shows the Varimax rotated factors of possible strategies to adopt and mitigate the effect of climate change. Variables that had loadings of 0.4 and above being included in naming the factors. Variables that loaded in more than one factor or had loadings below 0.4 were not used. Two factors were identified and named: agronomic methods (Factor 1) and research methods (Factor 2). Under the agronomic methods (Factor 1), the major strategies identified by farmers include changing the timing of farm operations (loading = 0.777), availability of extension service delivery (loading = 0.774), incorporation of residues into the soil (loading = 0.738), provision of adequate mulching materials (loading = 0.674), provision of infrastructure (loading = 0.550), use of resistant crops (loading = 0.535), and afforestation (loading = 0.414). In Factor 2, the research methods, the strategies identified are proper conservation of seeds (loading = 0.580), provision of adequate farm input supplies (loading = 0.437), and increased investment in agricultural research and development (loading = 0.424). Table 8 Table 8. Varimax rotated factors of possible strategies to adopt and mitigate the effect of climate change. 4 Discussion 4.1 Demographic characteristics of the farmers The United Nations reports that households in three Sub-Saharan African countries have an average of over 6 members each. Senegal stands out with one of the largest household sizes in Africa, averaging 10.8 members (United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division, 2019). These significant household sizes in Sub-Saharan Africa contribute to a valuable pool of labor for agricultural activities. The substantial household sizes in sub-Saharan Africa serve as a valuable labor reservoir for agricultural activities. Mr. Ode, a rural farmer said […I cannot afford machineries hence I use local labor, often involving family and friends…]. Compared to other regions such as North America and Europe, sub-Saharan Africa has larger average household size of 6.9 (Galal, 2023; Pew Research Center, 2023). This aligns with the result of this study of a mean household size of 6.43 people, indicating the families are relatively large and can contribute as a source of labor for farming activities. Thereby giving room for farming household to spend their extra income on other adaptive expenses. The empirical evidence from Swaziland underscored that sub-Saharan African countries could bear the brunt of climate change in terms of increased incidence of poverty and economic decline, with potential impacts on household welfare (Sam et al., 2021). The decrease in agricultural production due to the effects of climate change is a key contributing factor to farmers' reduced income. Findings showed that farmers have relatively low-income, indicating their reliance on income generated from the sales of their agricultural produce. This aligns firmly with related studies from sub-Saharan Africa (Ayanlade et al., 2018; Steinert et al., 2018; Ogada et al., 2020; Nwonu et al., 2022), which indicated that farmers within the region rely on personal savings. Farming experience is crucial to building climate resilience in traditional farming systems. Findings show that farmers have an average farming experience of 21.88 years, this implies that farmers in sub-Saharan Africa possess considerable experience addressing climate change issues in their farming practices, including adaptation and mitigation strategies (Sani and Chalchisa, 2016). However, support from governments and other organizations is crucial to enhance farmers' adaptation capacity and improve their access to resources and information. 4.2 Sources of information by farmers on climate change adaptation Smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa heavily rely on the environment for their livelihoods, making climate change adaptation crucial for their resilience. To achieve this, timely information on climate change adaptation strategies is vital. Although, there is limited information on the trend in climate information sources in sub-Saharan Africa. However, a study on smallholder farmers' climate resilience in Malawi and Ghana suggests that the relevance of information sources on climate change resilience is place-specific, and some sources may impede resilience (Amoak et al., 2023). Findings from the present study showed that across various survey regions, the main avenues through which individuals access information about climate change prominently include radio broadcasts, interactions with fellow farmers, and in-person discussions with neighbors. This widespread pattern of information dissemination aligns with the findings of multiple studies conducted not only in Anambra, as highlighted by Nwabugwu et al. (2019) and Uzochukwu et al. (2021), but also in diverse sub-Saharan African contexts. One of the noteworthy aspects of this information-sharing framework is the pivotal role of radio as a powerful and accessible medium for effectively communicating climate-related knowledge to diverse target groups across the region. According to and Antwi-Agyei et al. (2021) radio has proven to be a versatile tool in disseminating climate change information to both rural and urban communities, bridging information gaps, and promoting awareness and understanding of climate-related challenges. Additionally, community radio stations have been recognized for their ability to reach huge audiences and disseminate location-specific weather reporting, making them an effective tool for sharing climate information (Harvey et al., 2019; Global Center on Adaptation, 2023). This underscores the significance of radio as a primary and trusted source of climate-related information in sub-Saharan Africa. In addition to radio, the significance of peer interactions, particularly with fellow farmers and neighboring community members, emerges as a vital information source in the present study. A study on farmers' social networks and regional spillover effects in agricultural climate change mitigation emphasizes the positive influence of peer interactions on farmers' uptake of climate change adaptation measures (Kreft et al., 2023). Furthermore, a systematic review of smallholder farmers' climate change adaptation in sub-Saharan African indicated that knowledge integration and sharing within farming communities is important for adaptation to climate change (Jellason et al., 2022). This interpersonal exchange of knowledge within farming communities fosters the sharing of practical experiences, locally relevant adaptation strategies, and mitigation measures. Farmers can learn from one another's successes and challenges, making peer interactions a crucial component of climate change education and resilience-building efforts. It is important to acknowledge that while these channels are prevalent, there are variations in their prominence and effectiveness across sub-Saharan Africa's diverse regions and cultural contexts. 4.3 Effective traditional adaptation practices farmers use to cushion the effect of climate change Traditional adaptation practices are crucial for enhancing the climate change resilience of smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa. Findings show that all the tested traditional practices have high adoption rates as farmers utilize them to mitigate and adapt to climate change to minimize its effects. This aligns with the findings of the Crace (2019), which revealed that rural farmers have developed various strategies to reduce the impact of climate change, and these strategies have been tested and proven effective, reflecting farmers' perceptions and serving as effective mitigation and adaptation strategies. The increased application of organic manure by farmers serves multiple purposes, including enhancing soil fertility sustainably and increasing soil moisture content. Farmers noted that with rising temperatures and increased evapotranspiration caused by climate change, preserving moisture for crop use is crucial, making organic manure, planting of cover crops, bush fallow and mulching preferred options. They also emphasized that organic manure is cost-effective and readily available compared to inorganic fertilizers. This aligns with the findings of Quarshie et al. (2023) that traditional agricultural practitioners in sub-Saharan Africa implement on-farm adaptation options such as water management, and soil conservation techniques to combat climate change. Results showed that farmers deployed crop rotation, mixed cropping, intercropping, integrated crop-animal irrigation practices and shifting cultivation as key traditional soil and water management practices to adapt food crop production to climate change (Olumba et al., 2020; Benhin, 2021). This aligns with the findings of Naazie et al. (2023) who found that rural farmers in Ghana use crop diversification, intercropping, mixed farming and the adoption of improved crop varieties to adapt their agricultural production to climate change. Afforestation and agroforestry are important practices for promoting sustainable land use and mitigating the effects of climate change in sub-Saharan Africa. Results from the present study showed that farmers used afforestation and agroforestry techniques as an effective adaptation strategy as opposed mitigation strategy. These offers one of the most promising technological options for reversing soil degradation, restoring tree cover, and improving agricultural productivity in Africa. Famers reported the key agroforestry practices that helped them to adapt their agricultural system to climate change to include grazing or farming under savanna trees, growing coffee or cocoa under shade trees, planting fruit trees, sowing tree seeds on fallow land to speed up the restoration of fertility, planting “living” fences, windbreaks, or woodlots, combining trees, shrubs, and field crops in multistoried cropping systems, and growing crops between rows of nitrogen-fixing trees or shrubs (“alley cropping”). On the other hand, farmers also reported their engagement in tree planting campaigns in areas where there was no forest cover previously. In sub-Saharan Africa, afforestation programs have been implemented to combat deforestation and land degradation (Chomba et al., 2020). This is an effective traditional way of increasing soil cover, sequester carbon and mitigate the effects of climate change on rural agriculture. 4.4 Possible reasons for using traditional approaches to climate change adaptation Sub-Saharan African countries are incorporating traditional approaches to climate change adaptation due to their effectiveness and relevance to local conditions. Findings indicate that adopting traditional agricultural practices for climate change adaptation delivers multi-faceted benefits including enhancing soil quality and crop productivity by altering soil structure, promoting nutrient cycling, and reducing pests and diseases. Peoples and Baldock (2020) reported that crop rotation can increase the production of subsequent crops. Niggli et al. (2019) also stated that organic matter enhances soil resistance to drought and makes them adaptable to low and high rainfall conditions. Famers reported that improving over soil health, soil organic matter and crop yield, reducing greenhouse gas emission and enhancing resilience against climate variability are the major reasons why they use traditional approaches such as use of organic manure, traditional organic composting, afforestation and agroforestry, among others. The utilization of these techniques highlights the importance of diversifying agricultural practices to enhance climate resilience, which can serve as a model for other regions grappling with similar challenges. For instance, the successful implementation of afforestation and agroforestry initiatives in Southeast Nigeria as a means of enhancing the productivity of farming business demonstrates their potential as nature-based solutions to climate change that can be scaled up in similar agro-ecosystems. As climate change continues to pose challenges to agricultural systems across the continent, sharing and scaling up these effective practices can contribute significantly to building climate-resilient farming communities and ensuring food security for future generations in sub-Saharan Africa. 4.5 Constraints to adapting traditional agriculture to climate change Smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa face multifaceted challenges as they seek to adapt traditional agriculture to climate change. Lead farmers in the present study reported that poor agricultural extension services, pest and disease vulnerability, and inadequate dissemination of climate change information due to limited extension services are factors that hinder climate change adaptation, which corroborates the research conducted by Satishkumar et al. (2020). Studies in Nigeria and Ghana have highlighted constraints such as inadequate finance, scarcity of labor, inadequate access to climate information, and lack of access to weather information as significant barriers to farmers' efforts to adapt to climate change (Abegunde et al., 2019; Ige et al., 2021). Additionally, unpredictable weather conditions have been identified as a serious constraint to climate change adaptation strategies in Northern Ghana, affecting arable crop farmers' choice of adaptation strategies (Ige et al., 2021). On the other hand, findings showed that farmers do not have the knowledge to determine the level of accuracy of their climate information, because they never had real-time access to climate information. However, Fagariba et al. (2018) suggested that the inadequacy, inaccuracy, and inconsistency of climatic information available to farmers pose constraints in weather forecasting as an adaptation strategy to climate change. Furthermore, the high cost of accessing weather forecast information and its incompatibility with farmers' needs also hampers the adoption of weather forecasting as a reliable means of coping with the effects of climate change (Ojo et al., 2018). The result of the factor analysis resolved the constraints encountered by farmers into two components namely technical production and climate information problems. This is in tandem with the findings of Autio et al. (2021) who found that smallholder farmers in Southeast Kenya face challenges in adopting climate-smart agricultural practices due to limited access to productive resources and climate uncertainty. This is probably because formal climate adaptation strategies in sub-Saharan Africa often fail to consider the agency of smallholder farmers, leading to a disconnect between the strategies and the farmers' actual adaptation practices and needs. Addressing these constraints is crucial for the successful implementation of climate-smart agricultural practices and the resilience of agricultural systems in the region. 4.6 Possible strategies to adapt and mitigate the effect of climate change in traditional agricultural systems Climate change poses significant challenges to traditional agricultural systems in sub-Saharan Africa. Smallholder farmers in the region have been adapting to a changing climate, but there is a need for more comprehensive strategies to mitigate its effects. Farmers in the study area indicated that the use of climate-smart agriculture, the use of resistant crop varieties, afforestation, and other identified strategies can effectively mitigate the effects of climate change. This finding aligns with the research conducted by Ali et al. (2019), who highlighted the importance of using resistant crop varieties to adapt and build resilience to the effects of climate change. Resistant crops are known to survive and complete their life cycles even in adverse environmental conditions, providing a useful adaptation strategy (Barasa et al., 2021). Similarly, Jellason et al. (2022) indicated that on-farm adaptation options, agro-ecological intensification (AEI) practices, diversification and intercropping, adoption of improved crop varieties and soil and water management practices are crucial adaptation strategies to climate change in sub-Saharan Africa dry lands. The results further demonstrate that farmers have developed and tested various strategies to reduce the effects of climate change. This highlights their proactive approach to adopting measures to mitigate climate change and their ability to innovate and adapt to the changing environment. The results from the factor analysis categorized the strategies adopted by farmers into two categories namely agronomic methods and research methods for adaptation. Farmers indicated that adjusting the timing of farm operations, availability of extension services, incorporating crop residues into the soil, provision of mulching materials, infrastructure, and adoption of resistant crops and afforestation, are vital agronomic strategies to adapt traditional agriculture to climate change. In terms of the research methods to adaptations, farmers highlight the importance of proper seed conservation, availability of adequate farm inputs, and increased investment in agricultural research and development as crucial aspects to address in enhancing the resilience of their agricultural systems to climate change. 5 Conclusion This study provides valuable insights into the socioeconomic characteristics of farmers and their practices in adapting to climate change. The findings highlight the significant role of women in rural areas and their involvement in sustainable agriculture practices, as evidenced by a higher percentage of female respondents. The large household size and relatively low-income levels underscore the importance of agriculture as a primary source of livelihood for these farmers. Farmers have considerable experience addressing climate change issues, indicating their potential to collaborate and implement effective adaptation and mitigation strategies. However, the study also reveals the reliance on limited sources of climate change information, such as radio and fellow farmers, indicating the need for improved dissemination channels and access to diverse sources of knowledge. The study highlights the prevalent use of climate-smart traditional agricultural practices among indigenous people, including organic manure application and mixed farming, demonstrating farmers' proactive approach to mitigating the effects of climate change. These practices enhance soil fertility and moisture retention and improve crop productivity and resilience. Nevertheless, the study identifies constraints such as poor extension services, limited access to climate information, and technical challenges that hinder effective adaptation. These constraints require enhanced support systems, policy interventions, and agricultural research and development investments. In light of the findings, promoting climate-smart agriculture, the use of resistant crop varieties, afforestation, and sustainable farming practices emerge as essential strategies to mitigate the effects of climate change. By addressing the identified constraints and building upon farmers' existing knowledge and experiences, we can enhance their resilience, improve agricultural productivity, and contribute to sustainable rural development. 5.1 Policy implications of the findings • Strengthen extension services and diversify information sources: Governments should invest in and strengthen extension services to provide farmers with up-to-date climate change information, area-specific weather cues, agricultural best practices, and new technologies. And promote the use of diverse information sources, including indigenous channels, digital platforms and community-based knowledge sharing. • Promote climate-smart agricultural practices: Encourage the adoption of climate-smart agricultural practices through incentives, subsidies, and training programs.

Mbah3 1Department of Sustainability in Agriculture, Food Production and Food Technology, Hungarian University of Agricultural and Life Sciences, Godollo, Hungary 2Department of Agricultural Extension, University of Nigeria, Nsukka, Nigeria 3Department of Animal Science, University of Nigeria, Nsukka, Nigeria Introduction: Sub-Saharan Africa faces increasingly unpredictable and extreme weather patterns due to climate change, posing significant threats to food security and rural livelihoods. Traditional agriculture, deeply rooted in the region's history and culture, is particularly vulnerable to these changes. This study investigates the adaptation strategies of traditional agricultural farmers to climate change using southeast Nigeria as a microcosm of the broader challenges facing sub-Saharan Africa. Methods: Multistage sampling procedure was used to select 75 farmer group leaders in the study region. Cross-sectional data were collected through semi-structured interview schedules and focus group discussions. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and principal component analysis using Varimax rotated matrix. Results: Findings showed that farmers rely on face-to-face discussions with neighbors (76.0%), fellow farmers (66.7%), and radio (54.7%) as their primary sources of information on climate change. Results showed that traditional adaptation practices such as use of organic manure (x¯ = 3.89), traditional organic composting (x¯ = 3.80), afforestation (x¯ = 3.71), agroforestry (x¯ = 3.61) were the topmost traditional agricultural practices use to cushion the effect of climate change. Conserving the overall soil health, soil moisture retention, reducing CO2 emissions and maintaining crop productivity were the major reasons for using the traditional approaches. Climate-induced drought and high cost of accessing weather information (x¯ = 1.93), and inadequate funding (x¯ = 1.92), among others were the key constraints to adaptation. Discussion: Results showed that farmers prioritize agronomic manipulation and integrated research approaches as key strategies to adapting traditional agriculture to climate anomalies. Although farmers used their indigenous practices, continuous learning and improvement through capacity-building workshops and progress monitoring are essential for effective climate change adaptation. Policymakers should invest in promoting indigenous knowledge, provide access to credit for climate-resilient infrastructure, promote climate-smart agricultural practices and foster collaborative research as the cornerstone for sustainable rural development. 1 Introduction Sub-Saharan Africa, a vast and diverse region characterized by its rich cultural heritage and ecological variety, has long been recognized as a crucial battleground in the fight against climate change and its devastating consequences (Thompson et al., 2010). The region is particularly vulnerable to climate change, with multiple biophysical, political, and socioeconomic stresses interacting to affect rural communities, where agriculture is a major lifeline. Studies consistently predict decreased crop productivity, land degradation, high market prices, and negative impacts on livelihoods, exacerbating food insecurity in the region (Emediegwu et al., 2022; Oyelami et al., 2023). Climate change is intensifying food insecurity across sub-Saharan Africa, and leading to changes in yield and area growth, higher food prices, reduced calorie availability, and growing childhood malnutrition (Ringler et al., 2010). Salgado Baptista et al. (2022) projected the crop yield, especially in key staples, in the region to decline by 5–17% by 2050 due to rising temperatures and rainfall volatility. Successive weather shocks, such as droughts and floods, significantly raise food insecurity, particularly in countries where agricultural productivity is already below the global average (Salgado Baptista et al., 2022). With a predominantly agrarian economy dominated by stallholder farmers and a heavy reliance on traditional agricultural practices rooted in centuries of local knowledge and practices, the nations of sub-Saharan Africa are acutely vulnerable to the adverse impacts of a changing climate. Nigeria, as the most populous country in Africa, serves as a microcosm of the broader challenges and opportunities facing sub-Saharan Africa. It plays a pivotal role in the region's agricultural landscape and is emblematic of the broader climate adaptation issues faced by many nations in sub-Saharan Africa. Nigeria is estimated to contribute 14% of Africa's agriculture GDP, making it one of the top three African countries with the highest GDP contribution from agriculture (Oyaniran and Omomia, 2018). Between January and March 2021, agriculture contributed to 22.35% of Nigeria's GDP, with over 140 million Nigerians engaged in the sector mainly at a subsistence level. On formal level, more than 36% (above 28.9 million) of Nigeria's labor force was employed in agriculture, with over 80% of the agricultural workforce being smallholder farmers (FAO, 2019; Mayong et al., 2021; International Trade Administration, 2023). Nigeria possesses an abundance of arable land and a favorable climate to produce various crops, including maize, cassava, guinea corn, yam, beans, millet, and rice (FAO, 2019). However, despite its significant contribution to the economy, Nigeria's agricultural sector faces formidable challenges such as climate change and climate-induced socio-economic stressors. These challenges have stifled agricultural productivity, affecting the sector's contribution to the country's GDP and leading to increased food imports due to population growth (FAO, 2019). The impacts of climate change in Nigeria are characterized by increasing climate variability, leading to more intense and untimely rainfall, land degradation, flash floods, landslides, and gully erosion (Ghosh, 2019; World Bank, 2022). By 2009, an estimated 6,000 gullies were destroying infrastructure, farmland, and real estate across rural and urban Nigeria, causing fear and despair among the population (World Bank, 2022). The climate change-induced losses and unsustainable use of resources have elevated themselves to a real development challenge in Nigeria, particularly along the coastal states in the south and the northern frontline states, thwarting the age-old rhythms of traditional agriculture which are rooted in centuries of local knowledge and practices. The negative impacts of climate change on Nigeria's agriculture have been observed predominantly in the northern, northeastern, southwestern and southeast regions, which experience extreme weather conditions (Tajudeen et al., 2022; World Bank, 2022). The loss of life and property due to sudden, unpredictable, and uncontrollable floods is a nightmare for many Nigerians, destroying crops, farms, lands, and houses. The agricultural sector, which is the country's economic mainstay, is also grappling with lower crop yields, food insecurity, deepening poverty, forced displacement, labor inefficiency due to high temperatures and conflicts due to drought, flooding, sea level rise, erosion, and rapid decline in earth's limiting resources (Brouziyne et al., 2018; Obaji et al., 2022; United Nations Development Programme, 2023). In 2022 alone, climate-induced pests and diseases insurgence caused crop losses of up to 80% in some areas, impacting 1.5–200,000 hectares of land, and more than 20% of crops experienced post-harvest losses in several states (Adegwu, 2022). Major crops affected included maize, rice, sorghum, millet, soybean, groundnut, cowpea, root and tubers, fruits, vegetables, and tree crops in 33 states (Adegwu, 2022; Rizzo et al., 2023). The country's tropical climate is characterized by high temperatures, humidity, and rainfall, with larger amounts of rainfall experienced in the south and southeast regions of the country. Wind patterns are influenced by Nigeria's location and topography, largely due to the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) which brings moist winds from the Atlantic Ocean during the wet season and dry winds from the Sahara Desert during the dry season (Dia et al., 2023), which influences the annual temperature. The Nigeria temperature records indicate an average increase of 1.4–1.9°C, with predictions of further increases of 2–5°C by the end of the century if no decisive action is taken (Brouziyne et al., 2018). Nigeria is already experiencing the adverse effects of climate change, as with natural disasters are occurring more frequently and with greater intensity. These multi-dimensional adverse effects have not only hampered the ability of the agricultural sector to meet the country's food demands but have also disrupted the traditional roles of agriculture in Nigeria's economy, leading to a shift from being a net food exporter to an importer (Onyeneke et al., 2021). The cumulative agricultural imports of the country stood at N3.35 trillion between 2016 and 2019, which was four times higher than the agricultural export of N803 billion within the same period (FAO, 2019). Therefore, it is crucial to explore and implement interdisciplinary adaptation strategies that can enhance the sustainability and resilience of agri-food systems to climate anomalies. Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) has emerged as a competent response to the challenges posed by climate change on agriculture in rural areas. It entails the integration of traditional agricultural practices with modern techniques. Traditional agriculture, rooted in indigenous knowledge, cultural beliefs, and sustainable practices, offers valuable insights into adapting agricultural systems to a changing climate (Tsado, 2019). The approach of CSA is recognized for its potential to enhance farm productivity and incomes, adaptation, and resilience to climate change in rural African context (Abegunde and Obi, 2022). CSA offers a comprehensive strategy for addressing the interconnected challenges faced by smallholder farmers in African countries, focusing on three core goals: increasing agricultural productivity, adapting and building resilience to climate change, and developing opportunities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture (Obaji et al., 2022). Additionally, the FAO emphasizes that CSA is an approach that helps guide actions to transform agri-food systems toward green and climate-resilient practices, addressing challenges related to climate change and agriculture (FAO, 2023). However, CSA is not a one-size-fits-all approach and requires tailoring to specific climate risks faced by different farming communities, regions, and ecosystems. While CSA offers a solution to many of the secondary and tertiary problems caused by climate shocks, it is still not a familiar solution to climate adaptation and mitigation in last-mile communities. The effective utilization of CSA at grassroots is not just about understanding “how its works” but in appreciating the intricate web of cultural, economic, ecological, and technological factors that influence this adaptation tactics. Rural communities in sub-Saharan Africa are adapting their traditional agriculture to climate change through a variety of strategies and practices. Indigenous peoples and local communities are leveraging traditional knowledge and improved crop varieties to cope with extreme weather and environmental changes caused by climate change (Swiderska, 2011). Traditional agricultural practices, which have been developed over centuries, are proving to be valuable in building resilience and adapting to the impacts of climate change (Singh and Singh, 2017). Adjustments in planting dates, crop varieties, drainage systems, using advanced technologies and land management regimes to maintain yields and soil fertility (Arbuckle et al., 2015), are crucial on-the-ground strategies used by local farmers to counter the adverse effects of climatic changes. Traditional practices, such as agroforestry, intercropping, crop rotation, cover cropping, traditional organic composting, and integrated crop-animal farming, have demonstrated the potential to improve crop productivity and mitigate climate change impacts (Tripathi et al., 2019; Mashi et al., 2022). These practices, honed over thousands of years by indigenous farmers and local communities, provide valuable adaptation strategies in the face of climate uncertainties. Traditional agricultural practices have the potential to adapt and mitigate climate change through its unique agroecological features. They increase agrobiodiversity and resilience of agroecosystems, are low-cost, energy-efficient, and based on locally available resources (Singh and Singh, 2017). It is characterized by high productivity, biodiversity conservation, low energy inputs, and climate change mitigation (Singh and Singh, 2017). Therefore, integrating traditional knowledge into climate change policies is seen as a cost-effective, climate-smart approach and sustainable adaptation strategy to climate variability. While there is a growing recognition of the role of traditional knowledge in adapting agriculture to climate change, the role of indigenous knowledge and adaptive practices remains largely undervalued by decision-makers. Negotiating parties in international climate talks tend to focus on intensifying production through modern agriculture, overlooking the potential of traditional knowledge in adaptation (Swiderska, 2011). The unsustainable transition from traditional agriculture to modern methods in rural communities has led to the loss of crop genetic resources and environmental sustainability challenges, exacerbating the effects of climate change. Therefore, there is an urgent need to rediscover and re-implement traditional agricultural practices while integrating them with modern approaches to enhance the socio-ecological integrity of agroecosystems (Shittu et al., 2021). Ricart et al. (2023) analyzed a portfolio of 435 articles collected from WoS and Scopus databases between 2010 and 2020, finding that farmers are in a favorable position to offer first-hand observations and provide a deeper understanding of climate change manifestation, relevance, effects, and narratives. Therefore, farmers' knowledge provides a framework for appraising and incorporating new ideas, experiences, and information into existing systems (Haradhan, 2017). This study explored the adaptation strategies employed by farmers to mitigate the impacts of climate change on their indigenous agricultural system using southeast Nigeria as a model region for all riparian regions in sub-Saharan Africa. The specific objective of the study entails identifying the key climate change information sources by farmers; elicit the effective traditional adaptation practices farmers use to cushion the effect of climate change; examine the possible reasons for using traditional approaches to climate change adaptation, identify the constraints to adaptation, and the effective strategies to adapt and mitigate the effect of climate change. The grand objective of the study is to provide grassroots insights and recommendations for fostering sustainability and climate-resilient agri-food systems in sub-Saharan Africa. 2 Methodology The study was carried out in Southeast Nigeria, specifically within the geographical coordinates of latitudes 04° 17′N and 07° 06′N and longitudes 05° 23′E and 09° 28′E, as described in Macmillian's 2009 report. This region covers an area spanning 29,908 square kilometers and is inhabited by ~16,381,729 people, according to the Nigeria. National Bureau of Statistics (2007). It encompasses the territories of Abia state, Anambra state, Ebonyi state, Enugu state, and Imo state (see Figure 1). The climate of the Southeast can be broadly characterized as tropical, featuring distinct wet and dry seasons. It falls within the tropical belt, with early rainfall typically occurring in January/February and the full onset of the rainy season in March, concluding in November each year. The dry season typically lasts for 4–5 months, with the highest rainfall occurring from July to October, with a slight respite in August. On average, the region experiences an annual rainfall of ~1,952 mm, and the mean daily and annual temperatures are around 28 and 27°C, respectively (Igbokwe et al., 2008). Southeast Nigeria is primarily an agricultural area, with predominantly sandy and often loose and porous soil types. The most commonly cultivated crops in this region include cassava, rice, yam, cocoyam, maize, plantain/banana, cashew, oil palm, and coconut. Additionally, the major livestock raised in the area consist of goats, sheep, and poultry. In the southeastern region, the effects of climate change are readily noticeable, manifested in increased instances of flooding, landslides, and erosion, which have resulted in the loss of lives, homes, farmlands, properties, and roads, among other adverse consequences (Agwu and Okhimamhe, 2009). Figure 1 Figure 1. Map of southeast Nigeria. Source: Macmillian Atlas Series 2009. The population for the study comprised all farmers and relevant stakeholders operating in difficult-to-reach communities in the study region. Respondents were selected using a multi-stage sampling procedure. In the first stage, the five states that make up the Southeast Nigeria were selected purposefully to have good spread and depth of data and local perspectives. In the second stage, three senatorial zones were randomly selected in each state, given a total of 15 senatorial zones. In the third stage, five representative lead-farmers each were randomly selected from each of the 15 senatorial zones, given a total of 75 farmers used for the study. Data were collected using a semi-structure interview schedule and focus group discussion based on the specific objectives. The reliability of the instrument was tested using the Cronbach Alpha coefficient for internal consistency. The instrument was validated by experts in the Department of Agricultural Extension, University of Nigeria, Nsukka. Personal data, such as age (in years), gender (male or female), marital status (single, married, divorced/separated, and widowed), education (number of years spent in school), farming experience (years), household size (number of persons currently in the household), household monthly income (naira), estimated annual earnings (naira), access to extension service (number of times in the past 1 year), membership to the social organization(s), and access to credit facilities, were collected. Sources of information on climate change were collected by asking respondents to tick “Yes” or “No” from a list of information sources. Data on the effective traditional adaptation practices used to cushion the effects of climate change were collected by providing a list of perceived traditional practices. Respondents were required to rate the effective adaptive practices on a four-point Likert-type scale of very effective (4), effective (3), a little effective (2) and not effective (1). A mean score (2.5) was obtained. Variables with a mean score ≥2.5 were regarded as effective practices. Information on possible reasons for using traditional approaches for climate change adaptation were obtained by providing a list of variables for the respondents. Respondents were asked to rank the importance of traditional practices to their climate adaptation from a list of practices on a 3-point Likert scale of very important (3), important (2) and not important (1). A mean score (2) was obtained and all the variables with mean score ≥2 were regarded as important to adaptive capacity. Data on constraints to adaptation and mitigation were collected by asking the respondents to rank their constraints on a 3-point Likert scale of major constraint (2), minor constraint (1), not a constraint (0)—with a mean score of one. Data on the effectiveness of the strategies to mitigate the effect of climate change was measured by asking respondents to choose from a list of variables provided. Their responses were captured on a four-point Likert-type scale of very effective (4), effective (3), little effective (2), and not effective (1). A mean score (2.5) was obtained. Responses with a mean score ≥2.5 were regarded as effective. Excerpts from semi structure interviews and focus group discussions were reported in the result section of the article. Data obtained were analyzed with descriptive statistics (percentages, mean, and standard deviation) and principal component analysis using Varimax rotated factors analysis—through the IBM SPSS Statistics version 21 software. 3 Results 3.1 Socioeconomic characteristics of the farmers According to Table 1, results reveal that 52.0% of the respondents were female, while 48.0% were male. Regarding age distribution, most respondents (28.0%) fell within the 31–40 age range. Approximately 24.0% were aged between 41 and 50, 20.0% were 60 and above, and 18.7% were 30 and below. Only 9.3% were between 51 and 60 years old. The mean age of the farmers was 46.11, suggesting the active participation of middle-aged individuals in traditional agriculture. Regarding household size, a significant proportion (72.0%) of respondents had a household size of 5–8 persons, while 12.0% had 1–4 persons, and 16.0% had 8 or more persons. The results also indicate that the mean monthly household income was ₦20,093.33. Table 1 Table 1. Socioeconomic characteristics of the respondents (n = 75). 3.2 Sources of information by farmers on climate change adaptation The results in Table 2 indicate that most (76.0%) respondents obtain information on climate change, adaptation, and mitigation through face-to-face discussions with neighbors. This implies that community-based community approaches could be highly effective in disseminating information about climate change. Leveraging indigenous communication channels such as implementing community meetings or local discussion groups could be a strategic way to spread awareness and knowledge on climate adaptation and mitigation measures. Additionally, 66.7% of the respondents acquired information from fellow farmers. This implies that farmers probably trust and value the experiences and knowledge of their peers. Programs that engage local farmers as educators or facilitators could leverage this trust and peer influence for effective communication on climate resilience building. The reliance on radio by more than half 54.7% of respondents highlights its importance as a traditional but still relevant medium, especially in areas where digital connectivity might be limited. Radio programs focused on climate change, featuring expert advice, success stories from other farmers, and practical tips for adaptation and mitigation, could be a very effective outreach tool. Other information sources include videos (29.3%), newsletters on climate change (22.7%), internet (21.3%), television (20.0%), and among others. The variety of climate change information sources used by farmers underscores the need for a multi-channel communication strategy—since informal channels (neighbors and fellow farmers) could brood risk of misinformation or incomplete information being circulated. Table 2 Table 2. Source of information of farmers on climate changes (n = 75). 3.3 Effective traditional adaptation practices farmers use to cushion the effect of climate change In Table 3 show the traditional adaptation practices farmers use to cushion the effect of climate change. The traditional adaptation practices used include use of organic manure (x¯ = 3.89), traditional organic composting (x¯ = 3.80), afforestation (x¯ = 3.71), agroforestry (x¯ = 3.61), crop rotation (x¯ = 3.40), and mulching (x¯ = 3.37). These practices not only help in adapting to climate change but also contribute to mitigating its effects by enhancing carbon sequestration and biodiversity. For instance, the use of organic manure by the study participants is due to their accessibility, cost-effectiveness, or perceived effectiveness in improving soil health and resilience against climate variability. Excerpts from the focus group discussion indicate that farmers unanimously agree that [“…they use organic manure due to their accessibility, cost-effectiveness, or perceived effectiveness in improving soil health and resilience against climate variability…”]. Hence, these practices indicate a level of knowledge and adaptation to local climatic conditions. Table 3 Table 3. Traditional adaptation practices farmers use to cushion the effect of climate change (n = 75). Other traditional adaptation practices include intercropping (x¯ = 3.36), planting of cover crops and irrigation (x¯ = 3.29), integrated crop-animal farming (x¯ = 3.21), bush fallow practices (x¯ = 3.13), and among others. The use of intercropping and integrated crop-animal farming implies that indigenous people and communities prioritizes diversification as a key risk management strategy against the backdrop of climate change. Additionally, the use of irrigation, bush fallowing and covering crops indicates an awareness of and response to the need for optimal resource utilization, maintenance of soil health and sustainability, which is crucial for long-term agricultural productivity in the face of climate change. 3.4 Possible reasons for using traditional approaches to climate change adaptation Table 4 presents the key reasons for using traditional approaches to climate change adaptation. The reasons identified include increased soil fertility (x¯ = 2.95), aeration of soil (x¯ = 2.85), reduction of soil erosion (x¯ = 2.73), increase in soil moisture (x¯ = 2.03), enhancement of soil structure and aggregation (x¯ = 2.79), promotion of mineralization of nitrogen-containing compounds in the soil through the use of leguminous crops (x¯ = 2.68), reduction of nutrient loss from the soil (x¯ = 2.73), reduction of chemical pollution in the soil (x¯ = 2.33), and enhancement of agro-biodiversity through intercropping of legumes (x¯ = 2.56). This implies that farmers are aware of the importance of soil health in sustainable farming and climate change adaptation. This reflects a desire to maintain sustainable, eco-friendly farming practices that not only benefit the current crop but also contribute to the long-term health of the farm ecosystem. The reliance on traditional methods to deliver these benefits indicates a strong base of traditional agricultural knowledge and practices well-suited to local environmental conditions that have been passed down through generations. While these traditional practices are beneficial, there is potential for enhancing their effectiveness through the integration of scientific research and modern agricultural techniques. Table 4 Table 4. Possible reasons for using traditional approaches to climate change adaptation. 3.5 Constraints to adapting traditional agriculture to climate change Table 5 presents the constraints identified by the respondents to the use of traditional adaptation strategies. The major constraints to adaptation include climate variation leading to drought and high cost of accessing weather information (x¯ = 1.93), and inadequate funding (x¯ = 1.92). Access to micro-climate cues and finances are crucial in building local adaptation strategies. High cost of accessing reliable weather information frustrates traditional adaptive measures, making it difficult for farmers to plan and make informed climate-smart decisions effectively. It is therefore imperative to provide a more accessible, affordable, and accurate weather forecasting services tailored for farmers alongside financial assistance programs, subsidies, or microfinance solutions targeted at smallholder farmers. Participants also indicated that lack of technical knowledge and know-how (x¯ = 1.89) pose a major challenge to adapt. Mrs. Ngozika, a rural farmer from the study participant stated thus [“…I do not know the practical steps I could take to improve my farm activities in this era of climate change…”]. This implies a gap in the knowledge and skills necessary to implement effective adaptation strategies, which could probably be due to inadequate extension services or training programs. Inadequate infrastructure (x¯ = 1.87), such as roads and storage facilities, limits the ability of farmers to adapt to and mitigate the impacts of climate change. There is a need for governmental and non-governmental bodies to invest in rural infrastructure to support agricultural activities. Also, inadequate access to climate change information (x¯ = 1.85) present a formidable obstacle to rural adaptive capacities. This aligns with the high cost of accessing weather information and highlights a broader issue of information accessibility. Vulnerability to pests and diseases (x¯ = 1.83) resulting from climate change bedevils farmers adaptation efforts. Therefore, research into and promotion of climate-resilient crop varieties and integrated pest management practices are crucial for traditional agricultural systems. Other constraints faced by farmers include inadequate credit facilities (x¯ = 1.79), poor agricultural program and service delivery (x¯ = 1.69), high economic losses from farming (x¯ = 1.65), among others. Table 5 Table 5. Constraints to adaptation. Table 6 presents the results of the factor analysis of the constraints to adaptation. The variables with a loading of 0.4 score and above were included in naming the factors. Variables that loaded in more than one factor or had loadings below 0.4 were not used. Two key factors were identified and named: a technical problem (Factor 1) and a climate information problem (Factor 2). Under the technical problem (Factor 1), the major constraints identified by farmers include poor agricultural program and service delivery (loading = 0.768), high cost of farm operations (loading = 0.663), lack of skilled laboratory facilities for farm practices (loading = 0.650), inconsistent government policies (loading = 0.580), lack of extension services for providing information to farmers (loading = 0.539), high economic losses from farming (loading = 0.500), and vulnerability to pests and diseases (loading = 0.487). In Factor 2, the climate informational problem includes the high cost of accessing weather information (loading = 0.692) and drought climate variation (loading = 0.515). The factor analysis provides a clear framework for understanding the complex array of challenges in agricultural adaptation, emphasizing the need for comprehensive, well-coordinated responses that address both immediate technical issues and longer-term climate information accessibility challenges. Table 6 Table 6. Varimax rotated factors on constraints to adaptation. 3.6 Possible strategies to adapt and mitigate the effect of climate change Table 7 presents the respondents' responses regarding adopting respective mitigation measures. The major strategies adopted by farmers include the use of organic manure (x¯ = 3.87), use of resistant crops (score x¯ = 3.85), use of drought-resistant crops (x¯ = 3.68), and use of flood-tolerant crops (x¯ = 3.73). Farmers can adopt resistant crop varieties that are better suited to withstand the impacts of climate change, such as drought, extreme temperatures, and pests. Also, afforestation (planting trees; x¯ = 3.67), and use of use of cover crops (x¯ = 3.47) are important strategies to adapt and mitigate the effect of climate change. Excerpts from the focus group discussion indicate that farmers unanimously agree that [“…Planting palm, orange, and gmelina help remove climate pollutants from the atmosphere, contribute to climate change mitigation and provide additional benefits such as soil conservation and biodiversity enhancement…”]. Furthermore, the participant indicated access to reliable weather forecasting services (x¯ = 3.86) could help farmers make informed decisions and adapt their farming practices to changing climate conditions, thereby mitigating risks associated with irregular rainfall patterns. Famers also indicated that climate-smart agriculture practices (x¯ = 3.93) are important adaptation strategies. Implementing climate-smart agricultural practices, such as conservation tillage, diversified crop rotations, and rotational grazing, could effectively mitigate climate change impacts by sequestering carbon and enhancing soil health. Table 7 Table 7. Possible strategies to adopt and mitigate the effect of climate change (n = 75). Other important strategies identified by the respondents include incorporation of residues into the soil (x¯ = 3.23), proper conservation of seeds (x¯ = 3.75), provision of adequate mulching materials (x¯ = 3.40), among others. These strategies align with the principles of climate-resilient agriculture, which aims to enhance the adaptive capacity of agricultural systems and reduce their vulnerability to climate change while contributing to climate change mitigation. Table 8 shows the Varimax rotated factors of possible strategies to adopt and mitigate the effect of climate change. Variables that had loadings of 0.4 and above being included in naming the factors. Variables that loaded in more than one factor or had loadings below 0.4 were not used. Two factors were identified and named: agronomic methods (Factor 1) and research methods (Factor 2). Under the agronomic methods (Factor 1), the major strategies identified by farmers include changing the timing of farm operations (loading = 0.777), availability of extension service delivery (loading = 0.774), incorporation of residues into the soil (loading = 0.738), provision of adequate mulching materials (loading = 0.674), provision of infrastructure (loading = 0.550), use of resistant crops (loading = 0.535), and afforestation (loading = 0.414). In Factor 2, the research methods, the strategies identified are proper conservation of seeds (loading = 0.580), provision of adequate farm input supplies (loading = 0.437), and increased investment in agricultural research and development (loading = 0.424). Table 8 Table 8. Varimax rotated factors of possible strategies to adopt and mitigate the effect of climate change. 4 Discussion 4.1 Demographic characteristics of the farmers The United Nations reports that households in three Sub-Saharan African countries have an average of over 6 members each. Senegal stands out with one of the largest household sizes in Africa, averaging 10.8 members (United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division, 2019). These significant household sizes in Sub-Saharan Africa contribute to a valuable pool of labor for agricultural activities. The substantial household sizes in sub-Saharan Africa serve as a valuable labor reservoir for agricultural activities. Mr. Ode, a rural farmer said […I cannot afford machineries hence I use local labor, often involving family and friends…]. Compared to other regions such as North America and Europe, sub-Saharan Africa has larger average household size of 6.9 (Galal, 2023; Pew Research Center, 2023). This aligns with the result of this study of a mean household size of 6.43 people, indicating the families are relatively large and can contribute as a source of labor for farming activities. Thereby giving room for farming household to spend their extra income on other adaptive expenses. The empirical evidence from Swaziland underscored that sub-Saharan African countries could bear the brunt of climate change in terms of increased incidence of poverty and economic decline, with potential impacts on household welfare (Sam et al., 2021). The decrease in agricultural production due to the effects of climate change is a key contributing factor to farmers' reduced income. Findings showed that farmers have relatively low-income, indicating their reliance on income generated from the sales of their agricultural produce. This aligns firmly with related studies from sub-Saharan Africa (Ayanlade et al., 2018; Steinert et al., 2018; Ogada et al., 2020; Nwonu et al., 2022), which indicated that farmers within the region rely on personal savings. Farming experience is crucial to building climate resilience in traditional farming systems. Findings show that farmers have an average farming experience of 21.88 years, this implies that farmers in sub-Saharan Africa possess considerable experience addressing climate change issues in their farming practices, including adaptation and mitigation strategies (Sani and Chalchisa, 2016). However, support from governments and other organizations is crucial to enhance farmers' adaptation capacity and improve their access to resources and information. 4.2 Sources of information by farmers on climate change adaptation Smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa heavily rely on the environment for their livelihoods, making climate change adaptation crucial for their resilience. To achieve this, timely information on climate change adaptation strategies is vital. Although, there is limited information on the trend in climate information sources in sub-Saharan Africa. However, a study on smallholder farmers' climate resilience in Malawi and Ghana suggests that the relevance of information sources on climate change resilience is place-specific, and some sources may impede resilience (Amoak et al., 2023). Findings from the present study showed that across various survey regions, the main avenues through which individuals access information about climate change prominently include radio broadcasts, interactions with fellow farmers, and in-person discussions with neighbors. This widespread pattern of information dissemination aligns with the findings of multiple studies conducted not only in Anambra, as highlighted by Nwabugwu et al. (2019) and Uzochukwu et al. (2021), but also in diverse sub-Saharan African contexts. One of the noteworthy aspects of this information-sharing framework is the pivotal role of radio as a powerful and accessible medium for effectively communicating climate-related knowledge to diverse target groups across the region. According to and Antwi-Agyei et al. (2021) radio has proven to be a versatile tool in disseminating climate change information to both rural and urban communities, bridging information gaps, and promoting awareness and understanding of climate-related challenges. Additionally, community radio stations have been recognized for their ability to reach huge audiences and disseminate location-specific weather reporting, making them an effective tool for sharing climate information (Harvey et al., 2019; Global Center on Adaptation, 2023). This underscores the significance of radio as a primary and trusted source of climate-related information in sub-Saharan Africa. In addition to radio, the significance of peer interactions, particularly with fellow farmers and neighboring community members, emerges as a vital information source in the present study. A study on farmers' social networks and regional spillover effects in agricultural climate change mitigation emphasizes the positive influence of peer interactions on farmers' uptake of climate change adaptation measures (Kreft et al., 2023). Furthermore, a systematic review of smallholder farmers' climate change adaptation in sub-Saharan African indicated that knowledge integration and sharing within farming communities is important for adaptation to climate change (Jellason et al., 2022). This interpersonal exchange of knowledge within farming communities fosters the sharing of practical experiences, locally relevant adaptation strategies, and mitigation measures. Farmers can learn from one another's successes and challenges, making peer interactions a crucial component of climate change education and resilience-building efforts. It is important to acknowledge that while these channels are prevalent, there are variations in their prominence and effectiveness across sub-Saharan Africa's diverse regions and cultural contexts. 4.3 Effective traditional adaptation practices farmers use to cushion the effect of climate change Traditional adaptation practices are crucial for enhancing the climate change resilience of smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa. Findings show that all the tested traditional practices have high adoption rates as farmers utilize them to mitigate and adapt to climate change to minimize its effects. This aligns with the findings of the Crace (2019), which revealed that rural farmers have developed various strategies to reduce the impact of climate change, and these strategies have been tested and proven effective, reflecting farmers' perceptions and serving as effective mitigation and adaptation strategies. The increased application of organic manure by farmers serves multiple purposes, including enhancing soil fertility sustainably and increasing soil moisture content. Farmers noted that with rising temperatures and increased evapotranspiration caused by climate change, preserving moisture for crop use is crucial, making organic manure, planting of cover crops, bush fallow and mulching preferred options. They also emphasized that organic manure is cost-effective and readily available compared to inorganic fertilizers. This aligns with the findings of Quarshie et al. (2023) that traditional agricultural practitioners in sub-Saharan Africa implement on-farm adaptation options such as water management, and soil conservation techniques to combat climate change. Results showed that farmers deployed crop rotation, mixed cropping, intercropping, integrated crop-animal irrigation practices and shifting cultivation as key traditional soil and water management practices to adapt food crop production to climate change (Olumba et al., 2020; Benhin, 2021). This aligns with the findings of Naazie et al. (2023) who found that rural farmers in Ghana use crop diversification, intercropping, mixed farming and the adoption of improved crop varieties to adapt their agricultural production to climate change. Afforestation and agroforestry are important practices for promoting sustainable land use and mitigating the effects of climate change in sub-Saharan Africa. Results from the present study showed that farmers used afforestation and agroforestry techniques as an effective adaptation strategy as opposed mitigation strategy. These offers one of the most promising technological options for reversing soil degradation, restoring tree cover, and improving agricultural productivity in Africa. Famers reported the key agroforestry practices that helped them to adapt their agricultural system to climate change to include grazing or farming under savanna trees, growing coffee or cocoa under shade trees, planting fruit trees, sowing tree seeds on fallow land to speed up the restoration of fertility, planting “living” fences, windbreaks, or woodlots, combining trees, shrubs, and field crops in multistoried cropping systems, and growing crops between rows of nitrogen-fixing trees or shrubs (“alley cropping”). On the other hand, farmers also reported their engagement in tree planting campaigns in areas where there was no forest cover previously. In sub-Saharan Africa, afforestation programs have been implemented to combat deforestation and land degradation (Chomba et al., 2020). This is an effective traditional way of increasing soil cover, sequester carbon and mitigate the effects of climate change on rural agriculture. 4.4 Possible reasons for using traditional approaches to climate change adaptation Sub-Saharan African countries are incorporating traditional approaches to climate change adaptation due to their effectiveness and relevance to local conditions. Findings indicate that adopting traditional agricultural practices for climate change adaptation delivers multi-faceted benefits including enhancing soil quality and crop productivity by altering soil structure, promoting nutrient cycling, and reducing pests and diseases. Peoples and Baldock (2020) reported that crop rotation can increase the production of subsequent crops. Niggli et al. (2019) also stated that organic matter enhances soil resistance to drought and makes them adaptable to low and high rainfall conditions. Famers reported that improving over soil health, soil organic matter and crop yield, reducing greenhouse gas emission and enhancing resilience against climate variability are the major reasons why they use traditional approaches such as use of organic manure, traditional organic composting, afforestation and agroforestry, among others. The utilization of these techniques highlights the importance of diversifying agricultural practices to enhance climate resilience, which can serve as a model for other regions grappling with similar challenges. For instance, the successful implementation of afforestation and agroforestry initiatives in Southeast Nigeria as a means of enhancing the productivity of farming business demonstrates their potential as nature-based solutions to climate change that can be scaled up in similar agro-ecosystems. As climate change continues to pose challenges to agricultural systems across the continent, sharing and scaling up these effective practices can contribute significantly to building climate-resilient farming communities and ensuring food security for future generations in sub-Saharan Africa. 4.5 Constraints to adapting traditional agriculture to climate change Smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa face multifaceted challenges as they seek to adapt traditional agriculture to climate change. Lead farmers in the present study reported that poor agricultural extension services, pest and disease vulnerability, and inadequate dissemination of climate change information due to limited extension services are factors that hinder climate change adaptation, which corroborates the research conducted by Satishkumar et al. (2020). Studies in Nigeria and Ghana have highlighted constraints such as inadequate finance, scarcity of labor, inadequate access to climate information, and lack of access to weather information as significant barriers to farmers' efforts to adapt to climate change (Abegunde et al., 2019; Ige et al., 2021). Additionally, unpredictable weather conditions have been identified as a serious constraint to climate change adaptation strategies in Northern Ghana, affecting arable crop farmers' choice of adaptation strategies (Ige et al., 2021). On the other hand, findings showed that farmers do not have the knowledge to determine the level of accuracy of their climate information, because they never had real-time access to climate information. However, Fagariba et al. (2018) suggested that the inadequacy, inaccuracy, and inconsistency of climatic information available to farmers pose constraints in weather forecasting as an adaptation strategy to climate change. Furthermore, the high cost of accessing weather forecast information and its incompatibility with farmers' needs also hampers the adoption of weather forecasting as a reliable means of coping with the effects of climate change (Ojo et al., 2018). The result of the factor analysis resolved the constraints encountered by farmers into two components namely technical production and climate information problems. This is in tandem with the findings of Autio et al. (2021) who found that smallholder farmers in Southeast Kenya face challenges in adopting climate-smart agricultural practices due to limited access to productive resources and climate uncertainty. This is probably because formal climate adaptation strategies in sub-Saharan Africa often fail to consider the agency of smallholder farmers, leading to a disconnect between the strategies and the farmers' actual adaptation practices and needs. Addressing these constraints is crucial for the successful implementation of climate-smart agricultural practices and the resilience of agricultural systems in the region. 4.6 Possible strategies to adapt and mitigate the effect of climate change in traditional agricultural systems Climate change poses significant challenges to traditional agricultural systems in sub-Saharan Africa. Smallholder farmers in the region have been adapting to a changing climate, but there is a need for more comprehensive strategies to mitigate its effects. Farmers in the study area indicated that the use of climate-smart agriculture, the use of resistant crop varieties, afforestation, and other identified strategies can effectively mitigate the effects of climate change. This finding aligns with the research conducted by Ali et al. (2019), who highlighted the importance of using resistant crop varieties to adapt and build resilience to the effects of climate change. Resistant crops are known to survive and complete their life cycles even in adverse environmental conditions, providing a useful adaptation strategy (Barasa et al., 2021). Similarly, Jellason et al. (2022) indicated that on-farm adaptation options, agro-ecological intensification (AEI) practices, diversification and intercropping, adoption of improved crop varieties and soil and water management practices are crucial adaptation strategies to climate change in sub-Saharan Africa dry lands. The results further demonstrate that farmers have developed and tested various strategies to reduce the effects of climate change. This highlights their proactive approach to adopting measures to mitigate climate change and their ability to innovate and adapt to the changing environment. The results from the factor analysis categorized the strategies adopted by farmers into two categories namely agronomic methods and research methods for adaptation. Farmers indicated that adjusting the timing of farm operations, availability of extension services, incorporating crop residues into the soil, provision of mulching materials, infrastructure, and adoption of resistant crops and afforestation, are vital agronomic strategies to adapt traditional agriculture to climate change. In terms of the research methods to adaptations, farmers highlight the importance of proper seed conservation, availability of adequate farm inputs, and increased investment in agricultural research and development as crucial aspects to address in enhancing the resilience of their agricultural systems to climate change. 5 Conclusion This study provides valuable insights into the socioeconomic characteristics of farmers and their practices in adapting to climate change. The findings highlight the significant role of women in rural areas and their involvement in sustainable agriculture practices, as evidenced by a higher percentage of female respondents. The large household size and relatively low-income levels underscore the importance of agriculture as a primary source of livelihood for these farmers. Farmers have considerable experience addressing climate change issues, indicating their potential to collaborate and implement effective adaptation and mitigation strategies. However, the study also reveals the reliance on limited sources of climate change information, such as radio and fellow farmers, indicating the need for improved dissemination channels and access to diverse sources of knowledge. The study highlights the prevalent use of climate-smart traditional agricultural practices among indigenous people, including organic manure application and mixed farming, demonstrating farmers' proactive approach to mitigating the effects of climate change. These practices enhance soil fertility and moisture retention and improve crop productivity and resilience. Nevertheless, the study identifies constraints such as poor extension services, limited access to climate information, and technical challenges that hinder effective adaptation. These constraints require enhanced support systems, policy interventions, and agricultural research and development investments. In light of the findings, promoting climate-smart agriculture, the use of resistant crop varieties, afforestation, and sustainable farming practices emerge as essential strategies to mitigate the effects of climate change. By addressing the identified constraints and building upon farmers' existing knowledge and experiences, we can enhance their resilience, improve agricultural productivity, and contribute to sustainable rural development. 5.1 Policy implications of the findings • Strengthen extension services and diversify information sources: Governments should invest in and strengthen extension services to provide farmers with up-to-date climate change information, area-specific weather cues, agricultural best practices, and new technologies. And promote the use of diverse information sources, including indigenous channels, digital platforms and community-based knowledge sharing. • Promote climate-smart agricultural practices: Encourage the adoption of climate-smart agricultural practices through incentives, subsidies, and training programs. Governments should support research and development in climate-resilient crop varieties and livestock breeds. • Increase investment in agricultural research: Allocate more funding to agricultural research and innovation to develop climate-resilient technologies, improved crop varieties, and sustainable farming practices. • Access to credit for climate-resilient infrastructure: Facilitate access to credit and financial services for farmers to invest in climate-resilient infrastructure, such as irrigation systems, drought-resistant seeds, and storage facilities. • Supportive policies and collaborative networks: Create a conducive policy environment that encourages sustainable agricultural practices and promotes collaboration among various stakeholders, including government agencies, NGOs, and research institutions. • Capacity-Building Workshops and Progress Monitoring: Organize capacity-building workshops and training programs for farmers, extension workers, and other stakeholders to enhance their knowledge and skills in climate adaptation and mitigation. And also implement regular progress monitoring and evaluation to assess the effectiveness of climate adaptation efforts. • Enabling Environment for Continuous Learning and Improvement: Foster an environment that promotes continuous learning and improvement in agricultural practices. Encourage farmers to experiment with new techniques and technologies while providing them with the necessary support and resources. • Collaboration among policymakers, researchers, and local communities: Promote collaboration and coordination among policymakers, researchers, and local communities to ensure that climate-resilient and sustainable agricultural practices are developed, disseminated, and adopted effectively.

Traditional agriculture, deeply rooted in the region's history and culture, is particularly vulnerable to these changes. This study investigates the adaptation strategies of traditional agricultural farmers to climate change using southeast Nigeria as a microcosm of the broader challenges facing sub-Saharan Africa. Methods: Multistage sampling procedure was used to select 75 farmer group leaders in the study region. Cross-sectional data were collected through semi-structured interview schedules and focus group discussions. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and principal component analysis using Varimax rotated matrix. Results: Findings showed that farmers rely on face-to-face discussions with neighbors (76.0%), fellow farmers (66.7%), and radio (54.7%) as their primary sources of information on climate change. Results showed that traditional adaptation practices such as use of organic manure (x¯ = 3.89), traditional organic composting (x¯ = 3.80), afforestation (x¯ = 3.71), agroforestry (x¯ = 3.61) were the topmost traditional agricultural practices use to cushion the effect of climate change. Conserving the overall soil health, soil moisture retention, reducing CO2 emissions and maintaining crop productivity were the major reasons for using the traditional approaches. Climate-induced drought and high cost of accessing weather information (x¯ = 1.93), and inadequate funding (x¯ = 1.92), among others were the key constraints to adaptation. Discussion: Results showed that farmers prioritize agronomic manipulation and integrated research approaches as key strategies to adapting traditional agriculture to climate anomalies. Although farmers used their indigenous practices, continuous learning and improvement through capacity-building workshops and progress monitoring are essential for effective climate change adaptation. Policymakers should invest in promoting indigenous knowledge, provide access to credit for climate-resilient infrastructure, promote climate-smart agricultural practices and foster collaborative research as the cornerstone for sustainable rural development. 1 Introduction Sub-Saharan Africa, a vast and diverse region characterized by its rich cultural heritage and ecological variety, has long been recognized as a crucial battleground in the fight against climate change and its devastating consequences (Thompson et al., 2010). The region is particularly vulnerable to climate change, with multiple biophysical, political, and socioeconomic stresses interacting to affect rural communities, where agriculture is a major lifeline. Studies consistently predict decreased crop productivity, land degradation, high market prices, and negative impacts on livelihoods, exacerbating food insecurity in the region (Emediegwu et al., 2022; Oyelami et al., 2023). Climate change is intensifying food insecurity across sub-Saharan Africa, and leading to changes in yield and area growth, higher food prices, reduced calorie availability, and growing childhood malnutrition (Ringler et al., 2010). Salgado Baptista et al. (2022) projected the crop yield, especially in key staples, in the region to decline by 5–17% by 2050 due to rising temperatures and rainfall volatility. Successive weather shocks, such as droughts and floods, significantly raise food insecurity, particularly in countries where agricultural productivity is already below the global average (Salgado Baptista et al., 2022). With a predominantly agrarian economy dominated by stallholder farmers and a heavy reliance on traditional agricultural practices rooted in centuries of local knowledge and practices, the nations of sub-Saharan Africa are acutely vulnerable to the adverse impacts of a changing climate. Nigeria, as the most populous country in Africa, serves as a microcosm of the broader challenges and opportunities facing sub-Saharan Africa. It plays a pivotal role in the region's agricultural landscape and is emblematic of the broader climate adaptation issues faced by many nations in sub-Saharan Africa. Nigeria is estimated to contribute 14% of Africa's agriculture GDP, making it one of the top three African countries with the highest GDP contribution from agriculture (Oyaniran and Omomia, 2018). Between January and March 2021, agriculture contributed to 22.35% of Nigeria's GDP, with over 140 million Nigerians engaged in the sector mainly at a subsistence level. On formal level, more than 36% (above 28.9 million) of Nigeria's labor force was employed in agriculture, with over 80% of the agricultural workforce being smallholder farmers (FAO, 2019; Mayong et al., 2021; International Trade Administration, 2023). Nigeria possesses an abundance of arable land and a favorable climate to produce various crops, including maize, cassava, guinea corn, yam, beans, millet, and rice (FAO, 2019). However, despite its significant contribution to the economy, Nigeria's agricultural sector faces formidable challenges such as climate change and climate-induced socio-economic stressors. These challenges have stifled agricultural productivity, affecting the sector's contribution to the country's GDP and leading to increased food imports due to population growth (FAO, 2019). The impacts of climate change in Nigeria are characterized by increasing climate variability, leading to more intense and untimely rainfall, land degradation, flash floods, landslides, and gully erosion (Ghosh, 2019; World Bank, 2022). By 2009, an estimated 6,000 gullies were destroying infrastructure, farmland, and real estate across rural and urban Nigeria, causing fear and despair among the population (World Bank, 2022). The climate change-induced losses and unsustainable use of resources have elevated themselves to a real development challenge in Nigeria, particularly along the coastal states in the south and the northern frontline states, thwarting the age-old rhythms of traditional agriculture which are rooted in centuries of local knowledge and practices. The negative impacts of climate change on Nigeria's agriculture have been observed predominantly in the northern, northeastern, southwestern and southeast regions, which experience extreme weather conditions (Tajudeen et al., 2022; World Bank, 2022). The loss of life and property due to sudden, unpredictable, and uncontrollable floods is a nightmare for many Nigerians, destroying crops, farms, lands, and houses. The agricultural sector, which is the country's economic mainstay, is also grappling with lower crop yields, food insecurity, deepening poverty, forced displacement, labor inefficiency due to high temperatures and conflicts due to drought, flooding, sea level rise, erosion, and rapid decline in earth's limiting resources (Brouziyne et al., 2018; Obaji et al., 2022; United Nations Development Programme, 2023). In 2022 alone, climate-induced pests and diseases insurgence caused crop losses of up to 80% in some areas, impacting 1.5–200,000 hectares of land, and more than 20% of crops experienced post-harvest losses in several states (Adegwu, 2022). Major crops affected included maize, rice, sorghum, millet, soybean, groundnut, cowpea, root and tubers, fruits, vegetables, and tree crops in 33 states (Adegwu, 2022; Rizzo et al., 2023). The country's tropical climate is characterized by high temperatures, humidity, and rainfall, with larger amounts of rainfall experienced in the south and southeast regions of the country. Wind patterns are influenced by Nigeria's location and topography, largely due to the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) which brings moist winds from the Atlantic Ocean during the wet season and dry winds from the Sahara Desert during the dry season (Dia et al., 2023), which influences the annual temperature. The Nigeria temperature records indicate an average increase of 1.4–1.9°C, with predictions of further increases of 2–5°C by the end of the century if no decisive action is taken (Brouziyne et al., 2018). Nigeria is already experiencing the adverse effects of climate change, as with natural disasters are occurring more frequently and with greater intensity. These multi-dimensional adverse effects have not only hampered the ability of the agricultural sector to meet the country's food demands but have also disrupted the traditional roles of agriculture in Nigeria's economy, leading to a shift from being a net food exporter to an importer (Onyeneke et al., 2021). The cumulative agricultural imports of the country stood at N3.35 trillion between 2016 and 2019, which was four times higher than the agricultural export of N803 billion within the same period (FAO, 2019). Therefore, it is crucial to explore and implement interdisciplinary adaptation strategies that can enhance the sustainability and resilience of agri-food systems to climate anomalies. Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) has emerged as a competent response to the challenges posed by climate change on agriculture in rural areas. It entails the integration of traditional agricultural practices with modern techniques. Traditional agriculture, rooted in indigenous knowledge, cultural beliefs, and sustainable practices, offers valuable insights into adapting agricultural systems to a changing climate (Tsado, 2019). The approach of CSA is recognized for its potential to enhance farm productivity and incomes, adaptation, and resilience to climate change in rural African context (Abegunde and Obi, 2022). CSA offers a comprehensive strategy for addressing the interconnected challenges faced by smallholder farmers in African countries, focusing on three core goals: increasing agricultural productivity, adapting and building resilience to climate change, and developing opportunities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture (Obaji et al., 2022). Additionally, the FAO emphasizes that CSA is an approach that helps guide actions to transform agri-food systems toward green and climate-resilient practices, addressing challenges related to climate change and agriculture (FAO, 2023). However, CSA is not a one-size-fits-all approach and requires tailoring to specific climate risks faced by different farming communities, regions, and ecosystems. While CSA offers a solution to many of the secondary and tertiary problems caused by climate shocks, it is still not a familiar solution to climate adaptation and mitigation in last-mile communities. The effective utilization of CSA at grassroots is not just about understanding “how its works” but in appreciating the intricate web of cultural, economic, ecological, and technological factors that influence this adaptation tactics. Rural communities in sub-Saharan Africa are adapting their traditional agriculture to climate change through a variety of strategies and practices. Indigenous peoples and local communities are leveraging traditional knowledge and improved crop varieties to cope with extreme weather and environmental changes caused by climate change (Swiderska, 2011). Traditional agricultural practices, which have been developed over centuries, are proving to be valuable in building resilience and adapting to the impacts of climate change (Singh and Singh, 2017). Adjustments in planting dates, crop varieties, drainage systems, using advanced technologies and land management regimes to maintain yields and soil fertility (Arbuckle et al., 2015), are crucial on-the-ground strategies used by local farmers to counter the adverse effects of climatic changes. Traditional practices, such as agroforestry, intercropping, crop rotation, cover cropping, traditional organic composting, and integrated crop-animal farming, have demonstrated the potential to improve crop productivity and mitigate climate change impacts (Tripathi et al., 2019; Mashi et al., 2022). These practices, honed over thousands of years by indigenous farmers and local communities, provide valuable adaptation strategies in the face of climate uncertainties. Traditional agricultural practices have the potential to adapt and mitigate climate change through its unique agroecological features. They increase agrobiodiversity and resilience of agroecosystems, are low-cost, energy-efficient, and based on locally available resources (Singh and Singh, 2017). It is characterized by high productivity, biodiversity conservation, low energy inputs, and climate change mitigation (Singh and Singh, 2017). Therefore, integrating traditional knowledge into climate change policies is seen as a cost-effective, climate-smart approach and sustainable adaptation strategy to climate variability. While there is a growing recognition of the role of traditional knowledge in adapting agriculture to climate change, the role of indigenous knowledge and adaptive practices remains largely undervalued by decision-makers. Negotiating parties in international climate talks tend to focus on intensifying production through modern agriculture, overlooking the potential of traditional knowledge in adaptation (Swiderska, 2011). The unsustainable transition from traditional agriculture to modern methods in rural communities has led to the loss of crop genetic resources and environmental sustainability challenges, exacerbating the effects of climate change. Therefore, there is an urgent need to rediscover and re-implement traditional agricultural practices while integrating them with modern approaches to enhance the socio-ecological integrity of agroecosystems (Shittu et al., 2021). Ricart et al. (2023) analyzed a portfolio of 435 articles collected from WoS and Scopus databases between 2010 and 2020, finding that farmers are in a favorable position to offer first-hand observations and provide a deeper understanding of climate change manifestation, relevance, effects, and narratives. Therefore, farmers' knowledge provides a framework for appraising and incorporating new ideas, experiences, and information into existing systems (Haradhan, 2017). This study explored the adaptation strategies employed by farmers to mitigate the impacts of climate change on their indigenous agricultural system using southeast Nigeria as a model region for all riparian regions in sub-Saharan Africa. The specific objective of the study entails identifying the key climate change information sources by farmers; elicit the effective traditional adaptation practices farmers use to cushion the effect of climate change; examine the possible reasons for using traditional approaches to climate change adaptation, identify the constraints to adaptation, and the effective strategies to adapt and mitigate the effect of climate change. The grand objective of the study is to provide grassroots insights and recommendations for fostering sustainability and climate-resilient agri-food systems in sub-Saharan Africa. 2 Methodology The study was carried out in Southeast Nigeria, specifically within the geographical coordinates of latitudes 04° 17′N and 07° 06′N and longitudes 05° 23′E and 09° 28′E, as described in Macmillian's 2009 report. This region covers an area spanning 29,908 square kilometers and is inhabited by ~16,381,729 people, according to the Nigeria. National Bureau of Statistics (2007). It encompasses the territories of Abia state, Anambra state, Ebonyi state, Enugu state, and Imo state (see Figure 1). The climate of the Southeast can be broadly characterized as tropical, featuring distinct wet and dry seasons. It falls within the tropical belt, with early rainfall typically occurring in January/February and the full onset of the rainy season in March, concluding in November each year. The dry season typically lasts for 4–5 months, with the highest rainfall occurring from July to October, with a slight respite in August. On average, the region experiences an annual rainfall of ~1,952 mm, and the mean daily and annual temperatures are around 28 and 27°C, respectively (Igbokwe et al., 2008). Southeast Nigeria is primarily an agricultural area, with predominantly sandy and often loose and porous soil types. The most commonly cultivated crops in this region include cassava, rice, yam, cocoyam, maize, plantain/banana, cashew, oil palm, and coconut. Additionally, the major livestock raised in the area consist of goats, sheep, and poultry. In the southeastern region, the effects of climate change are readily noticeable, manifested in increased instances of flooding, landslides, and erosion, which have resulted in the loss of lives, homes, farmlands, properties, and roads, among other adverse consequences (Agwu and Okhimamhe, 2009). Figure 1 Figure 1. Map of southeast Nigeria. Source: Macmillian Atlas Series 2009. The population for the study comprised all farmers and relevant stakeholders operating in difficult-to-reach communities in the study region. Respondents were selected using a multi-stage sampling procedure. In the first stage, the five states that make up the Southeast Nigeria were selected purposefully to have good spread and depth of data and local perspectives. In the second stage, three senatorial zones were randomly selected in each state, given a total of 15 senatorial zones. In the third stage, five representative lead-farmers each were randomly selected from each of the 15 senatorial zones, given a total of 75 farmers used for the study. Data were collected using a semi-structure interview schedule and focus group discussion based on the specific objectives. The reliability of the instrument was tested using the Cronbach Alpha coefficient for internal consistency. The instrument was validated by experts in the Department of Agricultural Extension, University of Nigeria, Nsukka. Personal data, such as age (in years), gender (male or female), marital status (single, married, divorced/separated, and widowed), education (number of years spent in school), farming experience (years), household size (number of persons currently in the household), household monthly income (naira), estimated annual earnings (naira), access to extension service (number of times in the past 1 year), membership to the social organization(s), and access to credit facilities, were collected. Sources of information on climate change were collected by asking respondents to tick “Yes” or “No” from a list of information sources. Data on the effective traditional adaptation practices used to cushion the effects of climate change were collected by providing a list of perceived traditional practices. Respondents were required to rate the effective adaptive practices on a four-point Likert-type scale of very effective (4), effective (3), a little effective (2) and not effective (1). A mean score (2.5) was obtained. Variables with a mean score ≥2.5 were regarded as effective practices. Information on possible reasons for using traditional approaches for climate change adaptation were obtained by providing a list of variables for the respondents. Respondents were asked to rank the importance of traditional practices to their climate adaptation from a list of practices on a 3-point Likert scale of very important (3), important (2) and not important (1). A mean score (2) was obtained and all the variables with mean score ≥2 were regarded as important to adaptive capacity. Data on constraints to adaptation and mitigation were collected by asking the respondents to rank their constraints on a 3-point Likert scale of major constraint (2), minor constraint (1), not a constraint (0)—with a mean score of one. Data on the effectiveness of the strategies to mitigate the effect of climate change was measured by asking respondents to choose from a list of variables provided. Their responses were captured on a four-point Likert-type scale of very effective (4), effective (3), little effective (2), and not effective (1). A mean score (2.5) was obtained. Responses with a mean score ≥2.5 were regarded as effective. Excerpts from semi structure interviews and focus group discussions were reported in the result section of the article. Data obtained were analyzed with descriptive statistics (percentages, mean, and standard deviation) and principal component analysis using Varimax rotated factors analysis—through the IBM SPSS Statistics version 21 software. 3 Results 3.1 Socioeconomic characteristics of the farmers According to Table 1, results reveal that 52.0% of the respondents were female, while 48.0% were male. Regarding age distribution, most respondents (28.0%) fell within the 31–40 age range. Approximately 24.0% were aged between 41 and 50, 20.0% were 60 and above, and 18.7% were 30 and below. Only 9.3% were between 51 and 60 years old. The mean age of the farmers was 46.11, suggesting the active participation of middle-aged individuals in traditional agriculture. Regarding household size, a significant proportion (72.0%) of respondents had a household size of 5–8 persons, while 12.0% had 1–4 persons, and 16.0% had 8 or more persons. The results also indicate that the mean monthly household income was ₦20,093.33. Table 1 Table 1. Socioeconomic characteristics of the respondents (n = 75). 3.2 Sources of information by farmers on climate change adaptation The results in Table 2 indicate that most (76.0%) respondents obtain information on climate change, adaptation, and mitigation through face-to-face discussions with neighbors. This implies that community-based community approaches could be highly effective in disseminating information about climate change. Leveraging indigenous communication channels such as implementing community meetings or local discussion groups could be a strategic way to spread awareness and knowledge on climate adaptation and mitigation measures. Additionally, 66.7% of the respondents acquired information from fellow farmers. This implies that farmers probably trust and value the experiences and knowledge of their peers. Programs that engage local farmers as educators or facilitators could leverage this trust and peer influence for effective communication on climate resilience building. The reliance on radio by more than half 54.7% of respondents highlights its importance as a traditional but still relevant medium, especially in areas where digital connectivity might be limited. Radio programs focused on climate change, featuring expert advice, success stories from other farmers, and practical tips for adaptation and mitigation, could be a very effective outreach tool. Other information sources include videos (29.3%), newsletters on climate change (22.7%), internet (21.3%), television (20.0%), and among others. The variety of climate change information sources used by farmers underscores the need for a multi-channel communication strategy—since informal channels (neighbors and fellow farmers) could brood risk of misinformation or incomplete information being circulated. Table 2 Table 2. Source of information of farmers on climate changes (n = 75). 3.3 Effective traditional adaptation practices farmers use to cushion the effect of climate change In Table 3 show the traditional adaptation practices farmers use to cushion the effect of climate change. The traditional adaptation practices used include use of organic manure (x¯ = 3.89), traditional organic composting (x¯ = 3.80), afforestation (x¯ = 3.71), agroforestry (x¯ = 3.61), crop rotation (x¯ = 3.40), and mulching (x¯ = 3.37). These practices not only help in adapting to climate change but also contribute to mitigating its effects by enhancing carbon sequestration and biodiversity. For instance, the use of organic manure by the study participants is due to their accessibility, cost-effectiveness, or perceived effectiveness in improving soil health and resilience against climate variability. Excerpts from the focus group discussion indicate that farmers unanimously agree that [“…they use organic manure due to their accessibility, cost-effectiveness, or perceived effectiveness in improving soil health and resilience against climate variability…”]. Hence, these practices indicate a level of knowledge and adaptation to local climatic conditions. Table 3 Table 3. Traditional adaptation practices farmers use to cushion the effect of climate change (n = 75). Other traditional adaptation practices include intercropping (x¯ = 3.36), planting of cover crops and irrigation (x¯ = 3.29), integrated crop-animal farming (x¯ = 3.21), bush fallow practices (x¯ = 3.13), and among others. The use of intercropping and integrated crop-animal farming implies that indigenous people and communities prioritizes diversification as a key risk management strategy against the backdrop of climate change. Additionally, the use of irrigation, bush fallowing and covering crops indicates an awareness of and response to the need for optimal resource utilization, maintenance of soil health and sustainability, which is crucial for long-term agricultural productivity in the face of climate change. 3.4 Possible reasons for using traditional approaches to climate change adaptation Table 4 presents the key reasons for using traditional approaches to climate change adaptation. The reasons identified include increased soil fertility (x¯ = 2.95), aeration of soil (x¯ = 2.85), reduction of soil erosion (x¯ = 2.73), increase in soil moisture (x¯ = 2.03), enhancement of soil structure and aggregation (x¯ = 2.79), promotion of mineralization of nitrogen-containing compounds in the soil through the use of leguminous crops (x¯ = 2.68), reduction of nutrient loss from the soil (x¯ = 2.73), reduction of chemical pollution in the soil (x¯ = 2.33), and enhancement of agro-biodiversity through intercropping of legumes (x¯ = 2.56). This implies that farmers are aware of the importance of soil health in sustainable farming and climate change adaptation. This reflects a desire to maintain sustainable, eco-friendly farming practices that not only benefit the current crop but also contribute to the long-term health of the farm ecosystem. The reliance on traditional methods to deliver these benefits indicates a strong base of traditional agricultural knowledge and practices well-suited to local environmental conditions that have been passed down through generations. While these traditional practices are beneficial, there is potential for enhancing their effectiveness through the integration of scientific research and modern agricultural techniques. Table 4 Table 4. Possible reasons for using traditional approaches to climate change adaptation. 3.5 Constraints to adapting traditional agriculture to climate change Table 5 presents the constraints identified by the respondents to the use of traditional adaptation strategies. The major constraints to adaptation include climate variation leading to drought and high cost of accessing weather information (x¯ = 1.93), and inadequate funding (x¯ = 1.92). Access to micro-climate cues and finances are crucial in building local adaptation strategies. High cost of accessing reliable weather information frustrates traditional adaptive measures, making it difficult for farmers to plan and make informed climate-smart decisions effectively. It is therefore imperative to provide a more accessible, affordable, and accurate weather forecasting services tailored for farmers alongside financial assistance programs, subsidies, or microfinance solutions targeted at smallholder farmers. Participants also indicated that lack of technical knowledge and know-how (x¯ = 1.89) pose a major challenge to adapt. Mrs. Ngozika, a rural farmer from the study participant stated thus [“…I do not know the practical steps I could take to improve my farm activities in this era of climate change…”]. This implies a gap in the knowledge and skills necessary to implement effective adaptation strategies, which could probably be due to inadequate extension services or training programs. Inadequate infrastructure (x¯ = 1.87), such as roads and storage facilities, limits the ability of farmers to adapt to and mitigate the impacts of climate change. There is a need for governmental and non-governmental bodies to invest in rural infrastructure to support agricultural activities. Also, inadequate access to climate change information (x¯ = 1.85) present a formidable obstacle to rural adaptive capacities. This aligns with the high cost of accessing weather information and highlights a broader issue of information accessibility. Vulnerability to pests and diseases (x¯ = 1.83) resulting from climate change bedevils farmers adaptation efforts. Therefore, research into and promotion of climate-resilient crop varieties and integrated pest management practices are crucial for traditional agricultural systems. Other constraints faced by farmers include inadequate credit facilities (x¯ = 1.79), poor agricultural program and service delivery (x¯ = 1.69), high economic losses from farming (x¯ = 1.65), among others. Table 5 Table 5. Constraints to adaptation. Table 6 presents the results of the factor analysis of the constraints to adaptation. The variables with a loading of 0.4 score and above were included in naming the factors. Variables that loaded in more than one factor or had loadings below 0.4 were not used. Two key factors were identified and named: a technical problem (Factor 1) and a climate information problem (Factor 2). Under the technical problem (Factor 1), the major constraints identified by farmers include poor agricultural program and service delivery (loading = 0.768), high cost of farm operations (loading = 0.663), lack of skilled laboratory facilities for farm practices (loading = 0.650), inconsistent government policies (loading = 0.580), lack of extension services for providing information to farmers (loading = 0.539), high economic losses from farming (loading = 0.500), and vulnerability to pests and diseases (loading = 0.487). In Factor 2, the climate informational problem includes the high cost of accessing weather information (loading = 0.692) and drought climate variation (loading = 0.515). The factor analysis provides a clear framework for understanding the complex array of challenges in agricultural adaptation, emphasizing the need for comprehensive, well-coordinated responses that address both immediate technical issues and longer-term climate information accessibility challenges. Table 6 Table 6. Varimax rotated factors on constraints to adaptation. 3.6 Possible strategies to adapt and mitigate the effect of climate change Table 7 presents the respondents' responses regarding adopting respective mitigation measures. The major strategies adopted by farmers include the use of organic manure (x¯ = 3.87), use of resistant crops (score x¯ = 3.85), use of drought-resistant crops (x¯ = 3.68), and use of flood-tolerant crops (x¯ = 3.73). Farmers can adopt resistant crop varieties that are better suited to withstand the impacts of climate change, such as drought, extreme temperatures, and pests. Also, afforestation (planting trees; x¯ = 3.67), and use of use of cover crops (x¯ = 3.47) are important strategies to adapt and mitigate the effect of climate change. Excerpts from the focus group discussion indicate that farmers unanimously agree that [“…Planting palm, orange, and gmelina help remove climate pollutants from the atmosphere, contribute to climate change mitigation and provide additional benefits such as soil conservation and biodiversity enhancement…”]. Furthermore, the participant indicated access to reliable weather forecasting services (x¯ = 3.86) could help farmers make informed decisions and adapt their farming practices to changing climate conditions, thereby mitigating risks associated with irregular rainfall patterns. Famers also indicated that climate-smart agriculture practices (x¯ = 3.93) are important adaptation strategies. Implementing climate-smart agricultural practices, such as conservation tillage, diversified crop rotations, and rotational grazing, could effectively mitigate climate change impacts by sequestering carbon and enhancing soil health. Table 7 Table 7. Possible strategies to adopt and mitigate the effect of climate change (n = 75). Other important strategies identified by the respondents include incorporation of residues into the soil (x¯ = 3.23), proper conservation of seeds (x¯ = 3.75), provision of adequate mulching materials (x¯ = 3.40), among others. These strategies align with the principles of climate-resilient agriculture, which aims to enhance the adaptive capacity of agricultural systems and reduce their vulnerability to climate change while contributing to climate change mitigation. Table 8 shows the Varimax rotated factors of possible strategies to adopt and mitigate the effect of climate change. Variables that had loadings of 0.4 and above being included in naming the factors. Variables that loaded in more than one factor or had loadings below 0.4 were not used. Two factors were identified and named: agronomic methods (Factor 1) and research methods (Factor 2). Under the agronomic methods (Factor 1), the major strategies identified by farmers include changing the timing of farm operations (loading = 0.777), availability of extension service delivery (loading = 0.774), incorporation of residues into the soil (loading = 0.738), provision of adequate mulching materials (loading = 0.674), provision of infrastructure (loading = 0.550), use of resistant crops (loading = 0.535), and afforestation (loading = 0.414). In Factor 2, the research methods, the strategies identified are proper conservation of seeds (loading = 0.580), provision of adequate farm input supplies (loading = 0.437), and increased investment in agricultural research and development (loading = 0.424). Table 8 Table 8. Varimax rotated factors of possible strategies to adopt and mitigate the effect of climate change. 4 Discussion 4.1 Demographic characteristics of the farmers The United Nations reports that households in three Sub-Saharan African countries have an average of over 6 members each. Senegal stands out with one of the largest household sizes in Africa, averaging 10.8 members (United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division, 2019). These significant household sizes in Sub-Saharan Africa contribute to a valuable pool of labor for agricultural activities. The substantial household sizes in sub-Saharan Africa serve as a valuable labor reservoir for agricultural activities. Mr. Ode, a rural farmer said […I cannot afford machineries hence I use local labor, often involving family and friends…]. Compared to other regions such as North America and Europe, sub-Saharan Africa has larger average household size of 6.9 (Galal, 2023; Pew Research Center, 2023). This aligns with the result of this study of a mean household size of 6.43 people, indicating the families are relatively large and can contribute as a source of labor for farming activities. Thereby giving room for farming household to spend their extra income on other adaptive expenses. The empirical evidence from Swaziland underscored that sub-Saharan African countries could bear the brunt of climate change in terms of increased incidence of poverty and economic decline, with potential impacts on household welfare (Sam et al., 2021). The decrease in agricultural production due to the effects of climate change is a key contributing factor to farmers' reduced income. Findings showed that farmers have relatively low-income, indicating their reliance on income generated from the sales of their agricultural produce. This aligns firmly with related studies from sub-Saharan Africa (Ayanlade et al., 2018; Steinert et al., 2018; Ogada et al., 2020; Nwonu et al., 2022), which indicated that farmers within the region rely on personal savings. Farming experience is crucial to building climate resilience in traditional farming systems. Findings show that farmers have an average farming experience of 21.88 years, this implies that farmers in sub-Saharan Africa possess considerable experience addressing climate change issues in their farming practices, including adaptation and mitigation strategies (Sani and Chalchisa, 2016). However, support from governments and other organizations is crucial to enhance farmers' adaptation capacity and improve their access to resources and information. 4.2 Sources of information by farmers on climate change adaptation Smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa heavily rely on the environment for their livelihoods, making climate change adaptation crucial for their resilience. To achieve this, timely information on climate change adaptation strategies is vital. Although, there is limited information on the trend in climate information sources in sub-Saharan Africa. However, a study on smallholder farmers' climate resilience in Malawi and Ghana suggests that the relevance of information sources on climate change resilience is place-specific, and some sources may impede resilience (Amoak et al., 2023). Findings from the present study showed that across various survey regions, the main avenues through which individuals access information about climate change prominently include radio broadcasts, interactions with fellow farmers, and in-person discussions with neighbors. This widespread pattern of information dissemination aligns with the findings of multiple studies conducted not only in Anambra, as highlighted by Nwabugwu et al. (2019) and Uzochukwu et al. (2021), but also in diverse sub-Saharan African contexts. One of the noteworthy aspects of this information-sharing framework is the pivotal role of radio as a powerful and accessible medium for effectively communicating climate-related knowledge to diverse target groups across the region. According to and Antwi-Agyei et al. (2021) radio has proven to be a versatile tool in disseminating climate change information to both rural and urban communities, bridging information gaps, and promoting awareness and understanding of climate-related challenges. Additionally, community radio stations have been recognized for their ability to reach huge audiences and disseminate location-specific weather reporting, making them an effective tool for sharing climate information (Harvey et al., 2019; Global Center on Adaptation, 2023). This underscores the significance of radio as a primary and trusted source of climate-related information in sub-Saharan Africa. In addition to radio, the significance of peer interactions, particularly with fellow farmers and neighboring community members, emerges as a vital information source in the present study. A study on farmers' social networks and regional spillover effects in agricultural climate change mitigation emphasizes the positive influence of peer interactions on farmers' uptake of climate change adaptation measures (Kreft et al., 2023). Furthermore, a systematic review of smallholder farmers' climate change adaptation in sub-Saharan African indicated that knowledge integration and sharing within farming communities is important for adaptation to climate change (Jellason et al., 2022). This interpersonal exchange of knowledge within farming communities fosters the sharing of practical experiences, locally relevant adaptation strategies, and mitigation measures. Farmers can learn from one another's successes and challenges, making peer interactions a crucial component of climate change education and resilience-building efforts. It is important to acknowledge that while these channels are prevalent, there are variations in their prominence and effectiveness across sub-Saharan Africa's diverse regions and cultural contexts. 4.3 Effective traditional adaptation practices farmers use to cushion the effect of climate change Traditional adaptation practices are crucial for enhancing the climate change resilience of smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa. Findings show that all the tested traditional practices have high adoption rates as farmers utilize them to mitigate and adapt to climate change to minimize its effects. This aligns with the findings of the Crace (2019), which revealed that rural farmers have developed various strategies to reduce the impact of climate change, and these strategies have been tested and proven effective, reflecting farmers' perceptions and serving as effective mitigation and adaptation strategies. The increased application of organic manure by farmers serves multiple purposes, including enhancing soil fertility sustainably and increasing soil moisture content. Farmers noted that with rising temperatures and increased evapotranspiration caused by climate change, preserving moisture for crop use is crucial, making organic manure, planting of cover crops, bush fallow and mulching preferred options. They also emphasized that organic manure is cost-effective and readily available compared to inorganic fertilizers. This aligns with the findings of Quarshie et al. (2023) that traditional agricultural practitioners in sub-Saharan Africa implement on-farm adaptation options such as water management, and soil conservation techniques to combat climate change. Results showed that farmers deployed crop rotation, mixed cropping, intercropping, integrated crop-animal irrigation practices and shifting cultivation as key traditional soil and water management practices to adapt food crop production to climate change (Olumba et al., 2020; Benhin, 2021). This aligns with the findings of Naazie et al. (2023) who found that rural farmers in Ghana use crop diversification, intercropping, mixed farming and the adoption of improved crop varieties to adapt their agricultural production to climate change. Afforestation and agroforestry are important practices for promoting sustainable land use and mitigating the effects of climate change in sub-Saharan Africa. Results from the present study showed that farmers used afforestation and agroforestry techniques as an effective adaptation strategy as opposed mitigation strategy. These offers one of the most promising technological options for reversing soil degradation, restoring tree cover, and improving agricultural productivity in Africa. Famers reported the key agroforestry practices that helped them to adapt their agricultural system to climate change to include grazing or farming under savanna trees, growing coffee or cocoa under shade trees, planting fruit trees, sowing tree seeds on fallow land to speed up the restoration of fertility, planting “living” fences, windbreaks, or woodlots, combining trees, shrubs, and field crops in multistoried cropping systems, and growing crops between rows of nitrogen-fixing trees or shrubs (“alley cropping”). On the other hand, farmers also reported their engagement in tree planting campaigns in areas where there was no forest cover previously. In sub-Saharan Africa, afforestation programs have been implemented to combat deforestation and land degradation (Chomba et al., 2020). This is an effective traditional way of increasing soil cover, sequester carbon and mitigate the effects of climate change on rural agriculture. 4.4 Possible reasons for using traditional approaches to climate change adaptation Sub-Saharan African countries are incorporating traditional approaches to climate change adaptation due to their effectiveness and relevance to local conditions. Findings indicate that adopting traditional agricultural practices for climate change adaptation delivers multi-faceted benefits including enhancing soil quality and crop productivity by altering soil structure, promoting nutrient cycling, and reducing pests and diseases. Peoples and Baldock (2020) reported that crop rotation can increase the production of subsequent crops. Niggli et al. (2019) also stated that organic matter enhances soil resistance to drought and makes them adaptable to low and high rainfall conditions. Famers reported that improving over soil health, soil organic matter and crop yield, reducing greenhouse gas emission and enhancing resilience against climate variability are the major reasons why they use traditional approaches such as use of organic manure, traditional organic composting, afforestation and agroforestry, among others. The utilization of these techniques highlights the importance of diversifying agricultural practices to enhance climate resilience, which can serve as a model for other regions grappling with similar challenges. For instance, the successful implementation of afforestation and agroforestry initiatives in Southeast Nigeria as a means of enhancing the productivity of farming business demonstrates their potential as nature-based solutions to climate change that can be scaled up in similar agro-ecosystems. As climate change continues to pose challenges to agricultural systems across the continent, sharing and scaling up these effective practices can contribute significantly to building climate-resilient farming communities and ensuring food security for future generations in sub-Saharan Africa. 4.5 Constraints to adapting traditional agriculture to climate change Smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa face multifaceted challenges as they seek to adapt traditional agriculture to climate change. Lead farmers in the present study reported that poor agricultural extension services, pest and disease vulnerability, and inadequate dissemination of climate change information due to limited extension services are factors that hinder climate change adaptation, which corroborates the research conducted by Satishkumar et al. (2020). Studies in Nigeria and Ghana have highlighted constraints such as inadequate finance, scarcity of labor, inadequate access to climate information, and lack of access to weather information as significant barriers to farmers' efforts to adapt to climate change (Abegunde et al., 2019; Ige et al., 2021). Additionally, unpredictable weather conditions have been identified as a serious constraint to climate change adaptation strategies in Northern Ghana, affecting arable crop farmers' choice of adaptation strategies (Ige et al., 2021). On the other hand, findings showed that farmers do not have the knowledge to determine the level of accuracy of their climate information, because they never had real-time access to climate information. However, Fagariba et al. (2018) suggested that the inadequacy, inaccuracy, and inconsistency of climatic information available to farmers pose constraints in weather forecasting as an adaptation strategy to climate change. Furthermore, the high cost of accessing weather forecast information and its incompatibility with farmers' needs also hampers the adoption of weather forecasting as a reliable means of coping with the effects of climate change (Ojo et al., 2018). The result of the factor analysis resolved the constraints encountered by farmers into two components namely technical production and climate information problems. This is in tandem with the findings of Autio et al. (2021) who found that smallholder farmers in Southeast Kenya face challenges in adopting climate-smart agricultural practices due to limited access to productive resources and climate uncertainty. This is probably because formal climate adaptation strategies in sub-Saharan Africa often fail to consider the agency of smallholder farmers, leading to a disconnect between the strategies and the farmers' actual adaptation practices and needs. Addressing these constraints is crucial for the successful implementation of climate-smart agricultural practices and the resilience of agricultural systems in the region. 4.6 Possible strategies to adapt and mitigate the effect of climate change in traditional agricultural systems Climate change poses significant challenges to traditional agricultural systems in sub-Saharan Africa. Smallholder farmers in the region have been adapting to a changing climate, but there is a need for more comprehensive strategies to mitigate its effects. Farmers in the study area indicated that the use of climate-smart agriculture, the use of resistant crop varieties, afforestation, and other identified strategies can effectively mitigate the effects of climate change. This finding aligns with the research conducted by Ali et al. (2019), who highlighted the importance of using resistant crop varieties to adapt and build resilience to the effects of climate change. Resistant crops are known to survive and complete their life cycles even in adverse environmental conditions, providing a useful adaptation strategy (Barasa et al., 2021). Similarly, Jellason et al. (2022) indicated that on-farm adaptation options, agro-ecological intensification (AEI) practices, diversification and intercropping, adoption of improved crop varieties and soil and water management practices are crucial adaptation strategies to climate change in sub-Saharan Africa dry lands. The results further demonstrate that farmers have developed and tested various strategies to reduce the effects of climate change. This highlights their proactive approach to adopting measures to mitigate climate change and their ability to innovate and adapt to the changing environment. The results from the factor analysis categorized the strategies adopted by farmers into two categories namely agronomic methods and research methods for adaptation. Farmers indicated that adjusting the timing of farm operations, availability of extension services, incorporating crop residues into the soil, provision of mulching materials, infrastructure, and adoption of resistant crops and afforestation, are vital agronomic strategies to adapt traditional agriculture to climate change. In terms of the research methods to adaptations, farmers highlight the importance of proper seed conservation, availability of adequate farm inputs, and increased investment in agricultural research and development as crucial aspects to address in enhancing the resilience of their agricultural systems to climate change. 5 Conclusion This study provides valuable insights into the socioeconomic characteristics of farmers and their practices in adapting to climate change. The findings highlight the significant role of women in rural areas and their involvement in sustainable agriculture practices, as evidenced by a higher percentage of female respondents. The large household size and relatively low-income levels underscore the importance of agriculture as a primary source of livelihood for these farmers. Farmers have considerable experience addressing climate change issues, indicating their potential to collaborate and implement effective adaptation and mitigation strategies. However, the study also reveals the reliance on limited sources of climate change information, such as radio and fellow farmers, indicating the need for improved dissemination channels and access to diverse sources of knowledge. The study highlights the prevalent use of climate-smart traditional agricultural practices among indigenous people, including organic manure application and mixed farming, demonstrating farmers' proactive approach to mitigating the effects of climate change. These practices enhance soil fertility and moisture retention and improve crop productivity and resilience. Nevertheless, the study identifies constraints such as poor extension services, limited access to climate information, and technical challenges that hinder effective adaptation. These constraints require enhanced support systems, policy interventions, and agricultural research and development investments. In light of the findings, promoting climate-smart agriculture, the use of resistant crop varieties, afforestation, and sustainable farming practices emerge as essential strategies to mitigate the effects of climate change. By addressing the identified constraints and building upon farmers' existing knowledge and experiences, we can enhance their resilience, improve agricultural productivity, and contribute to sustainable rural development. 5.1 Policy implications of the findings • Strengthen extension services and diversify information sources: Governments should invest in and strengthen extension services to provide farmers with up-to-date climate change information, area-specific weather cues, agricultural best practices, and new technologies. And promote the use of diverse information sources, including indigenous channels, digital platforms and community-based knowledge sharing. • Promote climate-smart agricultural practices: Encourage the adoption of climate-smart agricultural practices through incentives, subsidies, and training programs. Governments should support research and development in climate-resilient crop varieties and livestock breeds. • Increase investment in agricultural research: Allocate more funding to agricultural research and innovation to develop climate-resilient technologies, improved crop varieties, and sustainable farming practices. • Access to credit for climate-resilient infrastructure: Facilitate access to credit and financial services for farmers to invest in climate-resilient infrastructure, such as irrigation systems, drought-resistant seeds, and storage facilities. • Supportive policies and collaborative networks: Create a conducive policy environment that encourages sustainable agricultural practices and promotes collaboration among various stakeholders, including government agencies, NGOs, and research institutions. • Capacity-Building Workshops and Progress Monitoring: Organize capacity-building workshops and training programs for farmers, extension workers, and other stakeholders to enhance their knowledge and skills in climate adaptation and mitigation. And also implement regular progress monitoring and evaluation to assess the effectiveness of climate adaptation efforts. • Enabling Environment for Continuous Learning and Improvement: Foster an environment that promotes continuous learning and improvement in agricultural practices. Encourage farmers to experiment with new techniques and technologies while providing them with the necessary support and resources. • Collaboration among policymakers, researchers, and local communities: Promote collaboration and coordination among policymakers, researchers, and local communities to ensure that climate-resilient and sustainable agricultural practices are developed, disseminated, and adopted effectively.

The region is particularly vulnerable to climate change, with multiple biophysical, political, and socioeconomic stresses interacting to affect rural communities, where agriculture is a major lifeline. Studies consistently predict decreased crop productivity, land degradation, high market prices, and negative impacts on livelihoods, exacerbating food insecurity in the region (Emediegwu et al., 2022; Oyelami et al., 2023). Climate change is intensifying food insecurity across sub-Saharan Africa, and leading to changes in yield and area growth, higher food prices, reduced calorie availability, and growing childhood malnutrition (Ringler et al., 2010). Salgado Baptista et al. (2022) projected the crop yield, especially in key staples, in the region to decline by 5–17% by 2050 due to rising temperatures and rainfall volatility. Successive weather shocks, such as droughts and floods, significantly raise food insecurity, particularly in countries where agricultural productivity is already below the global average (Salgado Baptista et al., 2022). With a predominantly agrarian economy dominated by stallholder farmers and a heavy reliance on traditional agricultural practices rooted in centuries of local knowledge and practices, the nations of sub-Saharan Africa are acutely vulnerable to the adverse impacts of a changing climate. Nigeria, as the most populous country in Africa, serves as a microcosm of the broader challenges and opportunities facing sub-Saharan Africa. It plays a pivotal role in the region's agricultural landscape and is emblematic of the broader climate adaptation issues faced by many nations in sub-Saharan Africa. Nigeria is estimated to contribute 14% of Africa's agriculture GDP, making it one of the top three African countries with the highest GDP contribution from agriculture (Oyaniran and Omomia, 2018). Between January and March 2021, agriculture contributed to 22.35% of Nigeria's GDP, with over 140 million Nigerians engaged in the sector mainly at a subsistence level. On formal level, more than 36% (above 28.9 million) of Nigeria's labor force was employed in agriculture, with over 80% of the agricultural workforce being smallholder farmers (FAO, 2019; Mayong et al., 2021; International Trade Administration, 2023). Nigeria possesses an abundance of arable land and a favorable climate to produce various crops, including maize, cassava, guinea corn, yam, beans, millet, and rice (FAO, 2019). However, despite its significant contribution to the economy, Nigeria's agricultural sector faces formidable challenges such as climate change and climate-induced socio-economic stressors. These challenges have stifled agricultural productivity, affecting the sector's contribution to the country's GDP and leading to increased food imports due to population growth (FAO, 2019). The impacts of climate change in Nigeria are characterized by increasing climate variability, leading to more intense and untimely rainfall, land degradation, flash floods, landslides, and gully erosion (Ghosh, 2019; World Bank, 2022). By 2009, an estimated 6,000 gullies were destroying infrastructure, farmland, and real estate across rural and urban Nigeria, causing fear and despair among the population (World Bank, 2022). The climate change-induced losses and unsustainable use of resources have elevated themselves to a real development challenge in Nigeria, particularly along the coastal states in the south and the northern frontline states, thwarting the age-old rhythms of traditional agriculture which are rooted in centuries of local knowledge and practices. The negative impacts of climate change on Nigeria's agriculture have been observed predominantly in the northern, northeastern, southwestern and southeast regions, which experience extreme weather conditions (Tajudeen et al., 2022; World Bank, 2022). The loss of life and property due to sudden, unpredictable, and uncontrollable floods is a nightmare for many Nigerians, destroying crops, farms, lands, and houses. The agricultural sector, which is the country's economic mainstay, is also grappling with lower crop yields, food insecurity, deepening poverty, forced displacement, labor inefficiency due to high temperatures and conflicts due to drought, flooding, sea level rise, erosion, and rapid decline in earth's limiting resources (Brouziyne et al., 2018; Obaji et al., 2022; United Nations Development Programme, 2023). In 2022 alone, climate-induced pests and diseases insurgence caused crop losses of up to 80% in some areas, impacting 1.5–200,000 hectares of land, and more than 20% of crops experienced post-harvest losses in several states (Adegwu, 2022). Major crops affected included maize, rice, sorghum, millet, soybean, groundnut, cowpea, root and tubers, fruits, vegetables, and tree crops in 33 states (Adegwu, 2022; Rizzo et al., 2023). The country's tropical climate is characterized by high temperatures, humidity, and rainfall, with larger amounts of rainfall experienced in the south and southeast regions of the country. Wind patterns are influenced by Nigeria's location and topography, largely due to the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) which brings moist winds from the Atlantic Ocean during the wet season and dry winds from the Sahara Desert during the dry season (Dia et al., 2023), which influences the annual temperature. The Nigeria temperature records indicate an average increase of 1.4–1.9°C, with predictions of further increases of 2–5°C by the end of the century if no decisive action is taken (Brouziyne et al., 2018). Nigeria is already experiencing the adverse effects of climate change, as with natural disasters are occurring more frequently and with greater intensity. These multi-dimensional adverse effects have not only hampered the ability of the agricultural sector to meet the country's food demands but have also disrupted the traditional roles of agriculture in Nigeria's economy, leading to a shift from being a net food exporter to an importer (Onyeneke et al., 2021). The cumulative agricultural imports of the country stood at N3.35 trillion between 2016 and 2019, which was four times higher than the agricultural export of N803 billion within the same period (FAO, 2019). Therefore, it is crucial to explore and implement interdisciplinary adaptation strategies that can enhance the sustainability and resilience of agri-food systems to climate anomalies. Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) has emerged as a competent response to the challenges posed by climate change on agriculture in rural areas. It entails the integration of traditional agricultural practices with modern techniques. Traditional agriculture, rooted in indigenous knowledge, cultural beliefs, and sustainable practices, offers valuable insights into adapting agricultural systems to a changing climate (Tsado, 2019). The approach of CSA is recognized for its potential to enhance farm productivity and incomes, adaptation, and resilience to climate change in rural African context (Abegunde and Obi, 2022). CSA offers a comprehensive strategy for addressing the interconnected challenges faced by smallholder farmers in African countries, focusing on three core goals: increasing agricultural productivity, adapting and building resilience to climate change, and developing opportunities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture (Obaji et al., 2022). Additionally, the FAO emphasizes that CSA is an approach that helps guide actions to transform agri-food systems toward green and climate-resilient practices, addressing challenges related to climate change and agriculture (FAO, 2023). However, CSA is not a one-size-fits-all approach and requires tailoring to specific climate risks faced by different farming communities, regions, and ecosystems. While CSA offers a solution to many of the secondary and tertiary problems caused by climate shocks, it is still not a familiar solution to climate adaptation and mitigation in last-mile communities. The effective utilization of CSA at grassroots is not just about understanding “how its works” but in appreciating the intricate web of cultural, economic, ecological, and technological factors that influence this adaptation tactics. Rural communities in sub-Saharan Africa are adapting their traditional agriculture to climate change through a variety of strategies and practices. Indigenous peoples and local communities are leveraging traditional knowledge and improved crop varieties to cope with extreme weather and environmental changes caused by climate change (Swiderska, 2011). Traditional agricultural practices, which have been developed over centuries, are proving to be valuable in building resilience and adapting to the impacts of climate change (Singh and Singh, 2017). Adjustments in planting dates, crop varieties, drainage systems, using advanced technologies and land management regimes to maintain yields and soil fertility (Arbuckle et al., 2015), are crucial on-the-ground strategies used by local farmers to counter the adverse effects of climatic changes. Traditional practices, such as agroforestry, intercropping, crop rotation, cover cropping, traditional organic composting, and integrated crop-animal farming, have demonstrated the potential to improve crop productivity and mitigate climate change impacts (Tripathi et al., 2019; Mashi et al., 2022). These practices, honed over thousands of years by indigenous farmers and local communities, provide valuable adaptation strategies in the face of climate uncertainties. Traditional agricultural practices have the potential to adapt and mitigate climate change through its unique agroecological features. They increase agrobiodiversity and resilience of agroecosystems, are low-cost, energy-efficient, and based on locally available resources (Singh and Singh, 2017). It is characterized by high productivity, biodiversity conservation, low energy inputs, and climate change mitigation (Singh and Singh, 2017). Therefore, integrating traditional knowledge into climate change policies is seen as a cost-effective, climate-smart approach and sustainable adaptation strategy to climate variability. While there is a growing recognition of the role of traditional knowledge in adapting agriculture to climate change, the role of indigenous knowledge and adaptive practices remains largely undervalued by decision-makers. Negotiating parties in international climate talks tend to focus on intensifying production through modern agriculture, overlooking the potential of traditional knowledge in adaptation (Swiderska, 2011). The unsustainable transition from traditional agriculture to modern methods in rural communities has led to the loss of crop genetic resources and environmental sustainability challenges, exacerbating the effects of climate change. Therefore, there is an urgent need to rediscover and re-implement traditional agricultural practices while integrating them with modern approaches to enhance the socio-ecological integrity of agroecosystems (Shittu et al., 2021). Ricart et al. (2023) analyzed a portfolio of 435 articles collected from WoS and Scopus databases between 2010 and 2020, finding that farmers are in a favorable position to offer first-hand observations and provide a deeper understanding of climate change manifestation, relevance, effects, and narratives. Therefore, farmers' knowledge provides a framework for appraising and incorporating new ideas, experiences, and information into existing systems (Haradhan, 2017). This study explored the adaptation strategies employed by farmers to mitigate the impacts of climate change on their indigenous agricultural system using southeast Nigeria as a model region for all riparian regions in sub-Saharan Africa. The specific objective of the study entails identifying the key climate change information sources by farmers; elicit the effective traditional adaptation practices farmers use to cushion the effect of climate change; examine the possible reasons for using traditional approaches to climate change adaptation, identify the constraints to adaptation, and the effective strategies to adapt and mitigate the effect of climate change. The grand objective of the study is to provide grassroots insights and recommendations for fostering sustainability and climate-resilient agri-food systems in sub-Saharan Africa. 2 Methodology The study was carried out in Southeast Nigeria, specifically within the geographical coordinates of latitudes 04° 17′N and 07° 06′N and longitudes 05° 23′E and 09° 28′E, as described in Macmillian's 2009 report. This region covers an area spanning 29,908 square kilometers and is inhabited by ~16,381,729 people, according to the Nigeria. National Bureau of Statistics (2007). It encompasses the territories of Abia state, Anambra state, Ebonyi state, Enugu state, and Imo state (see Figure 1). The climate of the Southeast can be broadly characterized as tropical, featuring distinct wet and dry seasons. It falls within the tropical belt, with early rainfall typically occurring in January/February and the full onset of the rainy season in March, concluding in November each year. The dry season typically lasts for 4–5 months, with the highest rainfall occurring from July to October, with a slight respite in August. On average, the region experiences an annual rainfall of ~1,952 mm, and the mean daily and annual temperatures are around 28 and 27°C, respectively (Igbokwe et al., 2008). Southeast Nigeria is primarily an agricultural area, with predominantly sandy and often loose and porous soil types. The most commonly cultivated crops in this region include cassava, rice, yam, cocoyam, maize, plantain/banana, cashew, oil palm, and coconut. Additionally, the major livestock raised in the area consist of goats, sheep, and poultry. In the southeastern region, the effects of climate change are readily noticeable, manifested in increased instances of flooding, landslides, and erosion, which have resulted in the loss of lives, homes, farmlands, properties, and roads, among other adverse consequences (Agwu and Okhimamhe, 2009). Figure 1 Figure 1. Map of southeast Nigeria. Source: Macmillian Atlas Series 2009. The population for the study comprised all farmers and relevant stakeholders operating in difficult-to-reach communities in the study region. Respondents were selected using a multi-stage sampling procedure. In the first stage, the five states that make up the Southeast Nigeria were selected purposefully to have good spread and depth of data and local perspectives. In the second stage, three senatorial zones were randomly selected in each state, given a total of 15 senatorial zones. In the third stage, five representative lead-farmers each were randomly selected from each of the 15 senatorial zones, given a total of 75 farmers used for the study. Data were collected using a semi-structure interview schedule and focus group discussion based on the specific objectives. The reliability of the instrument was tested using the Cronbach Alpha coefficient for internal consistency. The instrument was validated by experts in the Department of Agricultural Extension, University of Nigeria, Nsukka. Personal data, such as age (in years), gender (male or female), marital status (single, married, divorced/separated, and widowed), education (number of years spent in school), farming experience (years), household size (number of persons currently in the household), household monthly income (naira), estimated annual earnings (naira), access to extension service (number of times in the past 1 year), membership to the social organization(s), and access to credit facilities, were collected. Sources of information on climate change were collected by asking respondents to tick “Yes” or “No” from a list of information sources. Data on the effective traditional adaptation practices used to cushion the effects of climate change were collected by providing a list of perceived traditional practices. Respondents were required to rate the effective adaptive practices on a four-point Likert-type scale of very effective (4), effective (3), a little effective (2) and not effective (1). A mean score (2.5) was obtained. Variables with a mean score ≥2.5 were regarded as effective practices. Information on possible reasons for using traditional approaches for climate change adaptation were obtained by providing a list of variables for the respondents. Respondents were asked to rank the importance of traditional practices to their climate adaptation from a list of practices on a 3-point Likert scale of very important (3), important (2) and not important (1). A mean score (2) was obtained and all the variables with mean score ≥2 were regarded as important to adaptive capacity. Data on constraints to adaptation and mitigation were collected by asking the respondents to rank their constraints on a 3-point Likert scale of major constraint (2), minor constraint (1), not a constraint (0)—with a mean score of one. Data on the effectiveness of the strategies to mitigate the effect of climate change was measured by asking respondents to choose from a list of variables provided. Their responses were captured on a four-point Likert-type scale of very effective (4), effective (3), little effective (2), and not effective (1). A mean score (2.5) was obtained. Responses with a mean score ≥2.5 were regarded as effective. Excerpts from semi structure interviews and focus group discussions were reported in the result section of the article. Data obtained were analyzed with descriptive statistics (percentages, mean, and standard deviation) and principal component analysis using Varimax rotated factors analysis—through the IBM SPSS Statistics version 21 software. 3 Results 3.1 Socioeconomic characteristics of the farmers According to Table 1, results reveal that 52.0% of the respondents were female, while 48.0% were male. Regarding age distribution, most respondents (28.0%) fell within the 31–40 age range. Approximately 24.0% were aged between 41 and 50, 20.0% were 60 and above, and 18.7% were 30 and below. Only 9.3% were between 51 and 60 years old. The mean age of the farmers was 46.11, suggesting the active participation of middle-aged individuals in traditional agriculture. Regarding household size, a significant proportion (72.0%) of respondents had a household size of 5–8 persons, while 12.0% had 1–4 persons, and 16.0% had 8 or more persons. The results also indicate that the mean monthly household income was ₦20,093.33. Table 1 Table 1. Socioeconomic characteristics of the respondents (n = 75). 3.2 Sources of information by farmers on climate change adaptation The results in Table 2 indicate that most (76.0%) respondents obtain information on climate change, adaptation, and mitigation through face-to-face discussions with neighbors. This implies that community-based community approaches could be highly effective in disseminating information about climate change. Leveraging indigenous communication channels such as implementing community meetings or local discussion groups could be a strategic way to spread awareness and knowledge on climate adaptation and mitigation measures. Additionally, 66.7% of the respondents acquired information from fellow farmers. This implies that farmers probably trust and value the experiences and knowledge of their peers. Programs that engage local farmers as educators or facilitators could leverage this trust and peer influence for effective communication on climate resilience building. The reliance on radio by more than half 54.7% of respondents highlights its importance as a traditional but still relevant medium, especially in areas where digital connectivity might be limited. Radio programs focused on climate change, featuring expert advice, success stories from other farmers, and practical tips for adaptation and mitigation, could be a very effective outreach tool. Other information sources include videos (29.3%), newsletters on climate change (22.7%), internet (21.3%), television (20.0%), and among others. The variety of climate change information sources used by farmers underscores the need for a multi-channel communication strategy—since informal channels (neighbors and fellow farmers) could brood risk of misinformation or incomplete information being circulated. Table 2 Table 2. Source of information of farmers on climate changes (n = 75). 3.3 Effective traditional adaptation practices farmers use to cushion the effect of climate change In Table 3 show the traditional adaptation practices farmers use to cushion the effect of climate change. The traditional adaptation practices used include use of organic manure (x¯ = 3.89), traditional organic composting (x¯ = 3.80), afforestation (x¯ = 3.71), agroforestry (x¯ = 3.61), crop rotation (x¯ = 3.40), and mulching (x¯ = 3.37). These practices not only help in adapting to climate change but also contribute to mitigating its effects by enhancing carbon sequestration and biodiversity. For instance, the use of organic manure by the study participants is due to their accessibility, cost-effectiveness, or perceived effectiveness in improving soil health and resilience against climate variability. Excerpts from the focus group discussion indicate that farmers unanimously agree that [“…they use organic manure due to their accessibility, cost-effectiveness, or perceived effectiveness in improving soil health and resilience against climate variability…”]. Hence, these practices indicate a level of knowledge and adaptation to local climatic conditions. Table 3 Table 3. Traditional adaptation practices farmers use to cushion the effect of climate change (n = 75). Other traditional adaptation practices include intercropping (x¯ = 3.36), planting of cover crops and irrigation (x¯ = 3.29), integrated crop-animal farming (x¯ = 3.21), bush fallow practices (x¯ = 3.13), and among others. The use of intercropping and integrated crop-animal farming implies that indigenous people and communities prioritizes diversification as a key risk management strategy against the backdrop of climate change. Additionally, the use of irrigation, bush fallowing and covering crops indicates an awareness of and response to the need for optimal resource utilization, maintenance of soil health and sustainability, which is crucial for long-term agricultural productivity in the face of climate change. 3.4 Possible reasons for using traditional approaches to climate change adaptation Table 4 presents the key reasons for using traditional approaches to climate change adaptation. The reasons identified include increased soil fertility (x¯ = 2.95), aeration of soil (x¯ = 2.85), reduction of soil erosion (x¯ = 2.73), increase in soil moisture (x¯ = 2.03), enhancement of soil structure and aggregation (x¯ = 2.79), promotion of mineralization of nitrogen-containing compounds in the soil through the use of leguminous crops (x¯ = 2.68), reduction of nutrient loss from the soil (x¯ = 2.73), reduction of chemical pollution in the soil (x¯ = 2.33), and enhancement of agro-biodiversity through intercropping of legumes (x¯ = 2.56). This implies that farmers are aware of the importance of soil health in sustainable farming and climate change adaptation. This reflects a desire to maintain sustainable, eco-friendly farming practices that not only benefit the current crop but also contribute to the long-term health of the farm ecosystem. The reliance on traditional methods to deliver these benefits indicates a strong base of traditional agricultural knowledge and practices well-suited to local environmental conditions that have been passed down through generations. While these traditional practices are beneficial, there is potential for enhancing their effectiveness through the integration of scientific research and modern agricultural techniques. Table 4 Table 4. Possible reasons for using traditional approaches to climate change adaptation. 3.5 Constraints to adapting traditional agriculture to climate change Table 5 presents the constraints identified by the respondents to the use of traditional adaptation strategies. The major constraints to adaptation include climate variation leading to drought and high cost of accessing weather information (x¯ = 1.93), and inadequate funding (x¯ = 1.92). Access to micro-climate cues and finances are crucial in building local adaptation strategies. High cost of accessing reliable weather information frustrates traditional adaptive measures, making it difficult for farmers to plan and make informed climate-smart decisions effectively. It is therefore imperative to provide a more accessible, affordable, and accurate weather forecasting services tailored for farmers alongside financial assistance programs, subsidies, or microfinance solutions targeted at smallholder farmers. Participants also indicated that lack of technical knowledge and know-how (x¯ = 1.89) pose a major challenge to adapt. Mrs. Ngozika, a rural farmer from the study participant stated thus [“…I do not know the practical steps I could take to improve my farm activities in this era of climate change…”]. This implies a gap in the knowledge and skills necessary to implement effective adaptation strategies, which could probably be due to inadequate extension services or training programs. Inadequate infrastructure (x¯ = 1.87), such as roads and storage facilities, limits the ability of farmers to adapt to and mitigate the impacts of climate change. There is a need for governmental and non-governmental bodies to invest in rural infrastructure to support agricultural activities. Also, inadequate access to climate change information (x¯ = 1.85) present a formidable obstacle to rural adaptive capacities. This aligns with the high cost of accessing weather information and highlights a broader issue of information accessibility. Vulnerability to pests and diseases (x¯ = 1.83) resulting from climate change bedevils farmers adaptation efforts. Therefore, research into and promotion of climate-resilient crop varieties and integrated pest management practices are crucial for traditional agricultural systems. Other constraints faced by farmers include inadequate credit facilities (x¯ = 1.79), poor agricultural program and service delivery (x¯ = 1.69), high economic losses from farming (x¯ = 1.65), among others. Table 5 Table 5. Constraints to adaptation. Table 6 presents the results of the factor analysis of the constraints to adaptation. The variables with a loading of 0.4 score and above were included in naming the factors. Variables that loaded in more than one factor or had loadings below 0.4 were not used. Two key factors were identified and named: a technical problem (Factor 1) and a climate information problem (Factor 2). Under the technical problem (Factor 1), the major constraints identified by farmers include poor agricultural program and service delivery (loading = 0.768), high cost of farm operations (loading = 0.663), lack of skilled laboratory facilities for farm practices (loading = 0.650), inconsistent government policies (loading = 0.580), lack of extension services for providing information to farmers (loading = 0.539), high economic losses from farming (loading = 0.500), and vulnerability to pests and diseases (loading = 0.487). In Factor 2, the climate informational problem includes the high cost of accessing weather information (loading = 0.692) and drought climate variation (loading = 0.515). The factor analysis provides a clear framework for understanding the complex array of challenges in agricultural adaptation, emphasizing the need for comprehensive, well-coordinated responses that address both immediate technical issues and longer-term climate information accessibility challenges. Table 6 Table 6. Varimax rotated factors on constraints to adaptation. 3.6 Possible strategies to adapt and mitigate the effect of climate change Table 7 presents the respondents' responses regarding adopting respective mitigation measures. The major strategies adopted by farmers include the use of organic manure (x¯ = 3.87), use of resistant crops (score x¯ = 3.85), use of drought-resistant crops (x¯ = 3.68), and use of flood-tolerant crops (x¯ = 3.73). Farmers can adopt resistant crop varieties that are better suited to withstand the impacts of climate change, such as drought, extreme temperatures, and pests. Also, afforestation (planting trees; x¯ = 3.67), and use of use of cover crops (x¯ = 3.47) are important strategies to adapt and mitigate the effect of climate change. Excerpts from the focus group discussion indicate that farmers unanimously agree that [“…Planting palm, orange, and gmelina help remove climate pollutants from the atmosphere, contribute to climate change mitigation and provide additional benefits such as soil conservation and biodiversity enhancement…”]. Furthermore, the participant indicated access to reliable weather forecasting services (x¯ = 3.86) could help farmers make informed decisions and adapt their farming practices to changing climate conditions, thereby mitigating risks associated with irregular rainfall patterns. Famers also indicated that climate-smart agriculture practices (x¯ = 3.93) are important adaptation strategies. Implementing climate-smart agricultural practices, such as conservation tillage, diversified crop rotations, and rotational grazing, could effectively mitigate climate change impacts by sequestering carbon and enhancing soil health. Table 7 Table 7. Possible strategies to adopt and mitigate the effect of climate change (n = 75). Other important strategies identified by the respondents include incorporation of residues into the soil (x¯ = 3.23), proper conservation of seeds (x¯ = 3.75), provision of adequate mulching materials (x¯ = 3.40), among others. These strategies align with the principles of climate-resilient agriculture, which aims to enhance the adaptive capacity of agricultural systems and reduce their vulnerability to climate change while contributing to climate change mitigation. Table 8 shows the Varimax rotated factors of possible strategies to adopt and mitigate the effect of climate change. Variables that had loadings of 0.4 and above being included in naming the factors. Variables that loaded in more than one factor or had loadings below 0.4 were not used. Two factors were identified and named: agronomic methods (Factor 1) and research methods (Factor 2). Under the agronomic methods (Factor 1), the major strategies identified by farmers include changing the timing of farm operations (loading = 0.777), availability of extension service delivery (loading = 0.774), incorporation of residues into the soil (loading = 0.738), provision of adequate mulching materials (loading = 0.674), provision of infrastructure (loading = 0.550), use of resistant crops (loading = 0.535), and afforestation (loading = 0.414). In Factor 2, the research methods, the strategies identified are proper conservation of seeds (loading = 0.580), provision of adequate farm input supplies (loading = 0.437), and increased investment in agricultural research and development (loading = 0.424). Table 8 Table 8. Varimax rotated factors of possible strategies to adopt and mitigate the effect of climate change. 4 Discussion 4.1 Demographic characteristics of the farmers The United Nations reports that households in three Sub-Saharan African countries have an average of over 6 members each. Senegal stands out with one of the largest household sizes in Africa, averaging 10.8 members (United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division, 2019). These significant household sizes in Sub-Saharan Africa contribute to a valuable pool of labor for agricultural activities. The substantial household sizes in sub-Saharan Africa serve as a valuable labor reservoir for agricultural activities. Mr. Ode, a rural farmer said […I cannot afford machineries hence I use local labor, often involving family and friends…]. Compared to other regions such as North America and Europe, sub-Saharan Africa has larger average household size of 6.9 (Galal, 2023; Pew Research Center, 2023). This aligns with the result of this study of a mean household size of 6.43 people, indicating the families are relatively large and can contribute as a source of labor for farming activities. Thereby giving room for farming household to spend their extra income on other adaptive expenses. The empirical evidence from Swaziland underscored that sub-Saharan African countries could bear the brunt of climate change in terms of increased incidence of poverty and economic decline, with potential impacts on household welfare (Sam et al., 2021). The decrease in agricultural production due to the effects of climate change is a key contributing factor to farmers' reduced income. Findings showed that farmers have relatively low-income, indicating their reliance on income generated from the sales of their agricultural produce. This aligns firmly with related studies from sub-Saharan Africa (Ayanlade et al., 2018; Steinert et al., 2018; Ogada et al., 2020; Nwonu et al., 2022), which indicated that farmers within the region rely on personal savings. Farming experience is crucial to building climate resilience in traditional farming systems. Findings show that farmers have an average farming experience of 21.88 years, this implies that farmers in sub-Saharan Africa possess considerable experience addressing climate change issues in their farming practices, including adaptation and mitigation strategies (Sani and Chalchisa, 2016). However, support from governments and other organizations is crucial to enhance farmers' adaptation capacity and improve their access to resources and information. 4.2 Sources of information by farmers on climate change adaptation Smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa heavily rely on the environment for their livelihoods, making climate change adaptation crucial for their resilience. To achieve this, timely information on climate change adaptation strategies is vital. Although, there is limited information on the trend in climate information sources in sub-Saharan Africa. However, a study on smallholder farmers' climate resilience in Malawi and Ghana suggests that the relevance of information sources on climate change resilience is place-specific, and some sources may impede resilience (Amoak et al., 2023). Findings from the present study showed that across various survey regions, the main avenues through which individuals access information about climate change prominently include radio broadcasts, interactions with fellow farmers, and in-person discussions with neighbors. This widespread pattern of information dissemination aligns with the findings of multiple studies conducted not only in Anambra, as highlighted by Nwabugwu et al. (2019) and Uzochukwu et al. (2021), but also in diverse sub-Saharan African contexts. One of the noteworthy aspects of this information-sharing framework is the pivotal role of radio as a powerful and accessible medium for effectively communicating climate-related knowledge to diverse target groups across the region. According to and Antwi-Agyei et al. (2021) radio has proven to be a versatile tool in disseminating climate change information to both rural and urban communities, bridging information gaps, and promoting awareness and understanding of climate-related challenges. Additionally, community radio stations have been recognized for their ability to reach huge audiences and disseminate location-specific weather reporting, making them an effective tool for sharing climate information (Harvey et al., 2019; Global Center on Adaptation, 2023). This underscores the significance of radio as a primary and trusted source of climate-related information in sub-Saharan Africa. In addition to radio, the significance of peer interactions, particularly with fellow farmers and neighboring community members, emerges as a vital information source in the present study. A study on farmers' social networks and regional spillover effects in agricultural climate change mitigation emphasizes the positive influence of peer interactions on farmers' uptake of climate change adaptation measures (Kreft et al., 2023). Furthermore, a systematic review of smallholder farmers' climate change adaptation in sub-Saharan African indicated that knowledge integration and sharing within farming communities is important for adaptation to climate change (Jellason et al., 2022). This interpersonal exchange of knowledge within farming communities fosters the sharing of practical experiences, locally relevant adaptation strategies, and mitigation measures. Farmers can learn from one another's successes and challenges, making peer interactions a crucial component of climate change education and resilience-building efforts. It is important to acknowledge that while these channels are prevalent, there are variations in their prominence and effectiveness across sub-Saharan Africa's diverse regions and cultural contexts. 4.3 Effective traditional adaptation practices farmers use to cushion the effect of climate change Traditional adaptation practices are crucial for enhancing the climate change resilience of smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa. Findings show that all the tested traditional practices have high adoption rates as farmers utilize them to mitigate and adapt to climate change to minimize its effects. This aligns with the findings of the Crace (2019), which revealed that rural farmers have developed various strategies to reduce the impact of climate change, and these strategies have been tested and proven effective, reflecting farmers' perceptions and serving as effective mitigation and adaptation strategies. The increased application of organic manure by farmers serves multiple purposes, including enhancing soil fertility sustainably and increasing soil moisture content. Farmers noted that with rising temperatures and increased evapotranspiration caused by climate change, preserving moisture for crop use is crucial, making organic manure, planting of cover crops, bush fallow and mulching preferred options. They also emphasized that organic manure is cost-effective and readily available compared to inorganic fertilizers. This aligns with the findings of Quarshie et al. (2023) that traditional agricultural practitioners in sub-Saharan Africa implement on-farm adaptation options such as water management, and soil conservation techniques to combat climate change. Results showed that farmers deployed crop rotation, mixed cropping, intercropping, integrated crop-animal irrigation practices and shifting cultivation as key traditional soil and water management practices to adapt food crop production to climate change (Olumba et al., 2020; Benhin, 2021). This aligns with the findings of Naazie et al. (2023) who found that rural farmers in Ghana use crop diversification, intercropping, mixed farming and the adoption of improved crop varieties to adapt their agricultural production to climate change. Afforestation and agroforestry are important practices for promoting sustainable land use and mitigating the effects of climate change in sub-Saharan Africa. Results from the present study showed that farmers used afforestation and agroforestry techniques as an effective adaptation strategy as opposed mitigation strategy. These offers one of the most promising technological options for reversing soil degradation, restoring tree cover, and improving agricultural productivity in Africa. Famers reported the key agroforestry practices that helped them to adapt their agricultural system to climate change to include grazing or farming under savanna trees, growing coffee or cocoa under shade trees, planting fruit trees, sowing tree seeds on fallow land to speed up the restoration of fertility, planting “living” fences, windbreaks, or woodlots, combining trees, shrubs, and field crops in multistoried cropping systems, and growing crops between rows of nitrogen-fixing trees or shrubs (“alley cropping”). On the other hand, farmers also reported their engagement in tree planting campaigns in areas where there was no forest cover previously. In sub-Saharan Africa, afforestation programs have been implemented to combat deforestation and land degradation (Chomba et al., 2020). This is an effective traditional way of increasing soil cover, sequester carbon and mitigate the effects of climate change on rural agriculture. 4.4 Possible reasons for using traditional approaches to climate change adaptation Sub-Saharan African countries are incorporating traditional approaches to climate change adaptation due to their effectiveness and relevance to local conditions. Findings indicate that adopting traditional agricultural practices for climate change adaptation delivers multi-faceted benefits including enhancing soil quality and crop productivity by altering soil structure, promoting nutrient cycling, and reducing pests and diseases. Peoples and Baldock (2020) reported that crop rotation can increase the production of subsequent crops. Niggli et al. (2019) also stated that organic matter enhances soil resistance to drought and makes them adaptable to low and high rainfall conditions. Famers reported that improving over soil health, soil organic matter and crop yield, reducing greenhouse gas emission and enhancing resilience against climate variability are the major reasons why they use traditional approaches such as use of organic manure, traditional organic composting, afforestation and agroforestry, among others. The utilization of these techniques highlights the importance of diversifying agricultural practices to enhance climate resilience, which can serve as a model for other regions grappling with similar challenges. For instance, the successful implementation of afforestation and agroforestry initiatives in Southeast Nigeria as a means of enhancing the productivity of farming business demonstrates their potential as nature-based solutions to climate change that can be scaled up in similar agro-ecosystems. As climate change continues to pose challenges to agricultural systems across the continent, sharing and scaling up these effective practices can contribute significantly to building climate-resilient farming communities and ensuring food security for future generations in sub-Saharan Africa. 4.5 Constraints to adapting traditional agriculture to climate change Smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa face multifaceted challenges as they seek to adapt traditional agriculture to climate change. Lead farmers in the present study reported that poor agricultural extension services, pest and disease vulnerability, and inadequate dissemination of climate change information due to limited extension services are factors that hinder climate change adaptation, which corroborates the research conducted by Satishkumar et al. (2020). Studies in Nigeria and Ghana have highlighted constraints such as inadequate finance, scarcity of labor, inadequate access to climate information, and lack of access to weather information as significant barriers to farmers' efforts to adapt to climate change (Abegunde et al., 2019; Ige et al., 2021). Additionally, unpredictable weather conditions have been identified as a serious constraint to climate change adaptation strategies in Northern Ghana, affecting arable crop farmers' choice of adaptation strategies (Ige et al., 2021). On the other hand, findings showed that farmers do not have the knowledge to determine the level of accuracy of their climate information, because they never had real-time access to climate information. However, Fagariba et al. (2018) suggested that the inadequacy, inaccuracy, and inconsistency of climatic information available to farmers pose constraints in weather forecasting as an adaptation strategy to climate change. Furthermore, the high cost of accessing weather forecast information and its incompatibility with farmers' needs also hampers the adoption of weather forecasting as a reliable means of coping with the effects of climate change (Ojo et al., 2018). The result of the factor analysis resolved the constraints encountered by farmers into two components namely technical production and climate information problems. This is in tandem with the findings of Autio et al. (2021) who found that smallholder farmers in Southeast Kenya face challenges in adopting climate-smart agricultural practices due to limited access to productive resources and climate uncertainty. This is probably because formal climate adaptation strategies in sub-Saharan Africa often fail to consider the agency of smallholder farmers, leading to a disconnect between the strategies and the farmers' actual adaptation practices and needs. Addressing these constraints is crucial for the successful implementation of climate-smart agricultural practices and the resilience of agricultural systems in the region. 4.6 Possible strategies to adapt and mitigate the effect of climate change in traditional agricultural systems Climate change poses significant challenges to traditional agricultural systems in sub-Saharan Africa. Smallholder farmers in the region have been adapting to a changing climate, but there is a need for more comprehensive strategies to mitigate its effects. Farmers in the study area indicated that the use of climate-smart agriculture, the use of resistant crop varieties, afforestation, and other identified strategies can effectively mitigate the effects of climate change. This finding aligns with the research conducted by Ali et al. (2019), who highlighted the importance of using resistant crop varieties to adapt and build resilience to the effects of climate change. Resistant crops are known to survive and complete their life cycles even in adverse environmental conditions, providing a useful adaptation strategy (Barasa et al., 2021). Similarly, Jellason et al. (2022) indicated that on-farm adaptation options, agro-ecological intensification (AEI) practices, diversification and intercropping, adoption of improved crop varieties and soil and water management practices are crucial adaptation strategies to climate change in sub-Saharan Africa dry lands. The results further demonstrate that farmers have developed and tested various strategies to reduce the effects of climate change. This highlights their proactive approach to adopting measures to mitigate climate change and their ability to innovate and adapt to the changing environment. The results from the factor analysis categorized the strategies adopted by farmers into two categories namely agronomic methods and research methods for adaptation. Farmers indicated that adjusting the timing of farm operations, availability of extension services, incorporating crop residues into the soil, provision of mulching materials, infrastructure, and adoption of resistant crops and afforestation, are vital agronomic strategies to adapt traditional agriculture to climate change. In terms of the research methods to adaptations, farmers highlight the importance of proper seed conservation, availability of adequate farm inputs, and increased investment in agricultural research and development as crucial aspects to address in enhancing the resilience of their agricultural systems to climate change. 5 Conclusion This study provides valuable insights into the socioeconomic characteristics of farmers and their practices in adapting to climate change. The findings highlight the significant role of women in rural areas and their involvement in sustainable agriculture practices, as evidenced by a higher percentage of female respondents. The large household size and relatively low-income levels underscore the importance of agriculture as a primary source of livelihood for these farmers. Farmers have considerable experience addressing climate change issues, indicating their potential to collaborate and implement effective adaptation and mitigation strategies. However, the study also reveals the reliance on limited sources of climate change information, such as radio and fellow farmers, indicating the need for improved dissemination channels and access to diverse sources of knowledge. The study highlights the prevalent use of climate-smart traditional agricultural practices among indigenous people, including organic manure application and mixed farming, demonstrating farmers' proactive approach to mitigating the effects of climate change. These practices enhance soil fertility and moisture retention and improve crop productivity and resilience. Nevertheless, the study identifies constraints such as poor extension services, limited access to climate information, and technical challenges that hinder effective adaptation. These constraints require enhanced support systems, policy interventions, and agricultural research and development investments. In light of the findings, promoting climate-smart agriculture, the use of resistant crop varieties, afforestation, and sustainable farming practices emerge as essential strategies to mitigate the effects of climate change. By addressing the identified constraints and building upon farmers' existing knowledge and experiences, we can enhance their resilience, improve agricultural productivity, and contribute to sustainable rural development. 5.1 Policy implications of the findings • Strengthen extension services and diversify information sources: Governments should invest in and strengthen extension services to provide farmers with up-to-date climate change information, area-specific weather cues, agricultural best practices, and new technologies. And promote the use of diverse information sources, including indigenous channels, digital platforms and community-based knowledge sharing. • Promote climate-smart agricultural practices: Encourage the adoption of climate-smart agricultural practices through incentives, subsidies, and training programs. Governments should support research and development in climate-resilient crop varieties and livestock breeds. • Increase investment in agricultural research: Allocate more funding to agricultural research and innovation to develop climate-resilient technologies, improved crop varieties, and sustainable farming practices. • Access to credit for climate-resilient infrastructure: Facilitate access to credit and financial services for farmers to invest in climate-resilient infrastructure, such as irrigation systems, drought-resistant seeds, and storage facilities. • Supportive policies and collaborative networks: Create a conducive policy environment that encourages sustainable agricultural practices and promotes collaboration among various stakeholders, including government agencies, NGOs, and research institutions. • Capacity-Building Workshops and Progress Monitoring: Organize capacity-building workshops and training programs for farmers, extension workers, and other stakeholders to enhance their knowledge and skills in climate adaptation and mitigation. And also implement regular progress monitoring and evaluation to assess the effectiveness of climate adaptation efforts. • Enabling Environment for Continuous Learning and Improvement: Foster an environment that promotes continuous learning and improvement in agricultural practices. Encourage farmers to experiment with new techniques and technologies while providing them with the necessary support and resources. • Collaboration among policymakers, researchers, and local communities: Promote collaboration and coordination among policymakers, researchers, and local communities to ensure that climate-resilient and sustainable agricultural practices are developed, disseminated, and adopted effectively.

Google Scholar\\nSub-Saharan Africa, a vast and diverse region characterized by its rich cultural heritage and ecological variety, has long been recognized as a crucial battleground in the fight against climate change and its devastating consequences (Thompson et al., 2010). The region is particularly vulnerable to climate change, with multiple biophysical, political, and socioeconomic stresses interacting to affect rural communities, where agriculture is a major lifeline. Studies consistently predict decreased crop productivity, land degradation, high market prices, and negative impacts on livelihoods, exacerbating food insecurity in the region (Emediegwu et al., 2022; Oyelami et al., 2023). Climate change is intensifying food insecurity across sub-Saharan Africa, and leading to changes in yield and area growth, higher food prices, reduced calorie availability, and growing childhood malnutrition (Ringler et al., 2010). Salgado Baptista et al. (2022) projected the crop yield, especially in key staples, in the region to decline by 5–17% by 2050 due to rising temperatures and rainfall volatility. Successive weather shocks, such as droughts and floods, significantly raise food insecurity, particularly in countries where agricultural productivity is already below the global average (Salgado Baptista et al., 2022). With a predominantly agrarian economy dominated by stallholder farmers and a heavy reliance on traditional agricultural practices rooted in centuries of local knowledge and practices, the nations of sub-Saharan Africa are acutely vulnerable to the adverse impacts of a changing climate.\\nNigeria, as the most populous country in Africa, serves as a microcosm of the broader challenges and opportunities facing sub-Saharan Africa. It plays a pivotal role in the region's agricultural landscape and is emblematic of the broader climate adaptation issues faced by many nations in sub-Saharan Africa. Nigeria is estimated to contribute 14% of Africa's agriculture GDP, making it one of the top three African countries with the highest GDP contribution from agriculture (Oyaniran and Omomia, 2018). Between January and March 2021, agriculture contributed to 22.35% of Nigeria's GDP, with over 140 million Nigerians engaged in the sector mainly at a subsistence level. On formal level, more than 36% (above 28.9 million) of Nigeria's labor force was employed in agriculture, with over 80% of the agricultural workforce being smallholder farmers (FAO, 2019; Mayong et al., 2021; International Trade Administration, 2023). Nigeria possesses an abundance of arable land and a favorable climate to produce various crops, including maize, cassava, guinea corn, yam, beans, millet, and rice (FAO, 2019). However, despite its significant contribution to the economy, Nigeria's agricultural sector faces formidable challenges such as climate change and climate-induced socio-economic stressors. These challenges have stifled agricultural productivity, affecting the sector's contribution to the country's GDP and leading to increased food imports due to population growth (FAO, 2019).\\nThe impacts of climate change in Nigeria are characterized by increasing climate variability, leading to more intense and untimely rainfall, land degradation, flash floods, landslides, and gully erosion (Ghosh, 2019; World Bank, 2022). By 2009, an estimated 6,000 gullies were destroying infrastructure, farmland, and real estate across rural and urban Nigeria, causing fear and despair among the population (World Bank, 2022). The climate change-induced losses and unsustainable use of resources have elevated themselves to a real development challenge in Nigeria, particularly along the coastal states in the south and the northern frontline states, thwarting the age-old rhythms of traditional agriculture which are rooted in centuries of local knowledge and practices.\\nThe negative impacts of climate change on Nigeria's agriculture have been observed predominantly in the northern, northeastern, southwestern and southeast regions, which experience extreme weather conditions (Tajudeen et al., 2022; World Bank, 2022). The loss of life and property due to sudden, unpredictable, and uncontrollable floods is a nightmare for many Nigerians, destroying crops, farms, lands, and houses. The agricultural sector, which is the country's economic mainstay, is also grappling with lower crop yields, food insecurity, deepening poverty, forced displacement, labor inefficiency due to high temperatures and conflicts due to drought, flooding, sea level rise, erosion, and rapid decline in earth's limiting resources (Brouziyne et al., 2018; Obaji et al., 2022; United Nations Development Programme, 2023). In 2022 alone, climate-induced pests and diseases insurgence caused crop losses of up to 80% in some areas, impacting 1.5–200,000 hectares of land, and more than 20% of crops experienced post-harvest losses in several states (Adegwu, 2022). Major crops affected included maize, rice, sorghum, millet, soybean, groundnut, cowpea, root and tubers, fruits, vegetables, and tree crops in 33 states (Adegwu, 2022; Rizzo et al., 2023). The country's tropical climate is characterized by high temperatures, humidity, and rainfall, with larger amounts of rainfall experienced in the south and southeast regions of the country. Wind patterns are influenced by Nigeria's location and topography, largely due to the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) which brings moist winds from the Atlantic Ocean during the wet season and dry winds from the Sahara Desert during the dry season (Dia et al., 2023), which influences the annual temperature. The Nigeria temperature records indicate an average increase of 1.4–1.9°C, with predictions of further increases of 2–5°C by the end of the century if no decisive action is taken (Brouziyne et al., 2018).\\nNigeria is already experiencing the adverse effects of climate change, as with natural disasters are occurring more frequently and with greater intensity. These multi-dimensional adverse effects have not only hampered the ability of the agricultural sector to meet the country's food demands but have also disrupted the traditional roles of agriculture in Nigeria's economy, leading to a shift from being a net food exporter to an importer (Onyeneke et al., 2021). The cumulative agricultural imports of the country stood at N3.35 trillion between 2016 and 2019, which was four times higher than the agricultural export of N803 billion within the same period (FAO, 2019). Therefore, it is crucial to explore and implement interdisciplinary adaptation strategies that can enhance the sustainability and resilience of agri-food systems to climate anomalies.\\nClimate-smart agriculture (CSA) has emerged as a competent response to the challenges posed by climate change on agriculture in rural areas. It entails the integration of traditional agricultural practices with modern techniques. Traditional agriculture, rooted in indigenous knowledge, cultural beliefs, and sustainable practices, offers valuable insights into adapting agricultural systems to a changing climate (Tsado, 2019). The approach of CSA is recognized for its potential to enhance farm productivity and incomes, adaptation, and resilience to climate change in rural African context (Abegunde and Obi, 2022). CSA offers a comprehensive strategy for addressing the interconnected challenges faced by smallholder farmers in African countries, focusing on three core goals: increasing agricultural productivity, adapting and building resilience to climate change, and developing opportunities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture (Obaji et al., 2022). Additionally, the FAO emphasizes that CSA is an approach that helps guide actions to transform agri-food systems toward green and climate-resilient practices, addressing challenges related to climate change and agriculture (FAO, 2023). However, CSA is not a one-size-fits-all approach and requires tailoring to specific climate risks faced by different farming communities, regions, and ecosystems. While CSA offers a solution to many of the secondary and tertiary problems caused by climate shocks, it is still not a familiar solution to climate adaptation and mitigation in last-mile communities. The effective utilization of CSA at grassroots is not just about understanding “how its works” but in appreciating the intricate web of cultural, economic, ecological, and technological factors that influence this adaptation tactics.\\nRural communities in sub-Saharan Africa are adapting their traditional agriculture to climate change through a variety of strategies and practices. Indigenous peoples and local communities are leveraging traditional knowledge and improved crop varieties to cope with extreme weather and environmental changes caused by climate change (Swiderska, 2011). Traditional agricultural practices, which have been developed over centuries, are proving to be valuable in building resilience and adapting to the impacts of climate change (Singh and Singh, 2017). Adjustments in planting dates, crop varieties, drainage systems, using advanced technologies and land management regimes to maintain yields and soil fertility (Arbuckle et al., 2015), are crucial on-the-ground strategies used by local farmers to counter the adverse effects of climatic changes. Traditional practices, such as agroforestry, intercropping, crop rotation, cover cropping, traditional organic composting, and integrated crop-animal farming, have demonstrated the potential to improve crop productivity and mitigate climate change impacts (Tripathi et al., 2019; Mashi et al., 2022). These practices, honed over thousands of years by indigenous farmers and local communities, provide valuable adaptation strategies in the face of climate uncertainties.\\nTraditional agricultural practices have the potential to adapt and mitigate climate change through its unique agroecological features. They increase agrobiodiversity and resilience of agroecosystems, are low-cost, energy-efficient, and based on locally available resources (Singh and Singh, 2017). It is characterized by high productivity, biodiversity conservation, low energy inputs, and climate change mitigation (Singh and Singh, 2017). Therefore, integrating traditional knowledge into climate change policies is seen as a cost-effective, climate-smart approach and sustainable adaptation strategy to climate variability.\\nWhile there is a growing recognition of the role of traditional knowledge in adapting agriculture to climate change, the role of indigenous knowledge and adaptive practices remains largely undervalued by decision-makers. Negotiating parties in international climate talks tend to focus on intensifying production through modern agriculture, overlooking the potential of traditional knowledge in adaptation (Swiderska, 2011). The unsustainable transition from traditional agriculture to modern methods in rural communities has led to the loss of crop genetic resources and environmental sustainability challenges, exacerbating the effects of climate change. Therefore, there is an urgent need to rediscover and re-implement traditional agricultural practices while integrating them with modern approaches to enhance the socio-ecological integrity of agroecosystems (Shittu et al., 2021). Ricart et al. (2023) analyzed a portfolio of 435 articles collected from WoS and Scopus databases between 2010 and 2020, finding that farmers are in a favorable position to offer first-hand observations and provide a deeper understanding of climate change manifestation, relevance, effects, and narratives. Therefore, farmers' knowledge provides a framework for appraising and incorporating new ideas, experiences, and information into existing systems (Haradhan, 2017).\\nThis study explored the adaptation strategies employed by farmers to mitigate the impacts of climate change on their indigenous agricultural system using southeast Nigeria as a model region for all riparian regions in sub-Saharan Africa. The specific objective of the study entails identifying the key climate change information sources by farmers; elicit the effective traditional adaptation practices farmers use to cushion the effect of climate change; examine the possible reasons for using traditional approaches to climate change adaptation, identify the constraints to adaptation, and the effective strategies to adapt and mitigate the effect of climate change. The grand objective of the study is to provide grassroots insights and recommendations for fostering sustainability and climate-resilient agri-food systems in sub-Saharan Africa.\\nThe study was carried out in Southeast Nigeria, specifically within the geographical coordinates of latitudes 04° 17′N and 07° 06′N and longitudes 05° 23′E and 09° 28′E, as described in Macmillian's 2009 report. This region covers an area spanning 29,908 square kilometers and is inhabited by ~16,381,729 people, according to the Nigeria. National Bureau of Statistics (2007). It encompasses the territories of Abia state, Anambra state, Ebonyi state, Enugu state, and Imo state (see Figure 1). The climate of the Southeast can be broadly characterized as tropical, featuring distinct wet and dry seasons. It falls within the tropical belt, with early rainfall typically occurring in January/February and the full onset of the rainy season in March, concluding in November each year. The dry season typically lasts for 4–5 months, with the highest rainfall occurring from July to October, with a slight respite in August. On average, the region experiences an annual rainfall of ~1,952 mm, and the mean daily and annual temperatures are around 28 and 27°C, respectively (Igbokwe et al., 2008). Southeast Nigeria is primarily an agricultural area, with predominantly sandy and often loose and porous soil types. The most commonly cultivated crops in this region include cassava, rice, yam, cocoyam, maize, plantain/banana, cashew, oil palm, and coconut. Additionally, the major livestock raised in the area consist of goats, sheep, and poultry. In the southeastern region, the effects of climate change are readily noticeable, manifested in increased instances of flooding, landslides, and erosion, which have resulted in the loss of lives, homes, farmlands, properties, and roads, among other adverse consequences (Agwu and Okhimamhe, 2009).\\nFigure 1. Map of southeast Nigeria. Source: Macmillian Atlas Series 2009.\\nFigure 1. Map of southeast Nigeria. Source: Macmillian Atlas Series 2009.\\nThe population for the study comprised all farmers and relevant stakeholders operating in difficult-to-reach communities in the study region. Respondents were selected using a multi-stage sampling procedure. In the first stage, the five states that make up the Southeast Nigeria were selected purposefully to have good spread and depth of data and local perspectives. In the second stage, three senatorial zones were randomly selected in each state, given a total of 15 senatorial zones. In the third stage, five representative lead-farmers each were randomly selected from each of the 15 senatorial zones, given a total of 75 farmers used for the study. Data were collected using a semi-structure interview schedule and focus group discussion based on the specific objectives. The reliability of the instrument was tested using the Cronbach Alpha coefficient for internal consistency. The instrument was validated by experts in the Department of Agricultural Extension, University of Nigeria, Nsukka.\\nPersonal data, such as age (in years), gender (male or female), marital status (single, married, divorced/separated, and widowed), education (number of years spent in school), farming experience (years), household size (number of persons currently in the household), household monthly income (naira), estimated annual earnings (naira), access to extension service (number of times in the past 1 year), membership to the social organization(s), and access to credit facilities, were collected. Sources of information on climate change were collected by asking respondents to tick “Yes” or “No” from a list of information sources. Data on the effective traditional adaptation practices used to cushion the effects of climate change were collected by providing a list of perceived traditional practices. Respondents were required to rate the effective adaptive practices on a four-point Likert-type scale of very effective (4), effective (3), a little effective (2) and not effective (1). A mean score (2.5) was obtained. Variables with a mean score ≥2.5 were regarded as effective practices. Information on possible reasons for using traditional approaches for climate change adaptation were obtained by providing a list of variables for the respondents. Respondents were asked to rank the importance of traditional practices to their climate adaptation from a list of practices on a 3-point Likert scale of very important (3), important (2) and not important (1). A mean score (2) was obtained and all the variables with mean score ≥2 were regarded as important to adaptive capacity. Data on constraints to adaptation and mitigation were collected by asking the respondents to rank their constraints on a 3-point Likert scale of major constraint (2), minor constraint (1), not a constraint (0)—with a mean score of one.\\nData on the effectiveness of the strategies to mitigate the effect of climate change was measured by asking respondents to choose from a list of variables provided. Their responses were captured on a four-point Likert-type scale of very effective (4), effective (3), little effective (2), and not effective (1). A mean score (2.5) was obtained. Responses with a mean score ≥2.5 were regarded as effective. Excerpts from semi structure interviews and focus group discussions were reported in the result section of the article. Data obtained were analyzed with descriptive statistics (percentages, mean, and standard deviation) and principal component analysis using Varimax rotated factors analysis—through the IBM SPSS Statistics version 21 software.\\n3.1 Socioeconomic characteristics of the farmers\\nAccording to Table 1, results reveal that 52.0% of the respondents were female, while 48.0% were male. Regarding age distribution, most respondents (28.0%) fell within the 31–40 age range. Approximately 24.0% were aged between 41 and 50, 20.0% were 60 and above, and 18.7% were 30 and below. Only 9.3% were between 51 and 60 years old. The mean age of the farmers was 46.11, suggesting the active participation of middle-aged individuals in traditional agriculture. Regarding household size, a significant proportion (72.0%) of respondents had a household size of 5–8 persons, while 12.0% had 1–4 persons, and 16.0% had 8 or more persons. The results also indicate that the mean monthly household income was ₦20,093.33.\\nTable 1. Socioeconomic characteristics of the respondents (n = 75).\\nTable 1. Socioeconomic characteristics of the respondents (n = 75).\\n3.2 Sources of information by farmers on climate change adaptation\\nThe results in Table 2 indicate that most (76.0%) respondents obtain information on climate change, adaptation, and mitigation through face-to-face discussions with neighbors. This implies that community-based community approaches could be highly effective in disseminating information about climate change. Leveraging indigenous communication channels such as implementing community meetings or local discussion groups could be a strategic way to spread awareness and knowledge on climate adaptation and mitigation measures. Additionally, 66.7% of the respondents acquired information from fellow farmers. This implies that farmers probably trust and value the experiences and knowledge of their peers. Programs that engage local farmers as educators or facilitators could leverage this trust and peer influence for effective communication on climate resilience building. The reliance on radio by more than half 54.7% of respondents highlights its importance as a traditional but still relevant medium, especially in areas where digital connectivity might be limited. Radio programs focused on climate change, featuring expert advice, success stories from other farmers, and practical tips for adaptation and mitigation, could be a very effective outreach tool. Other information sources include videos (29.3%), newsletters on climate change (22.7%), internet (21.3%), television (20.0%), and among others. The variety of climate change information sources used by farmers underscores the need for a multi-channel communication strategy—since informal channels (neighbors and fellow farmers) could brood risk of misinformation or incomplete information being circulated.\\nTable 2. Source of information of farmers on climate changes (n = 75).\\nTable 2. Source of information of farmers on climate changes (n = 75).\\n3.3 Effective traditional adaptation practices farmers use to cushion the effect of climate change\\nIn Table 3 show the traditional adaptation practices farmers use to cushion the effect of climate change. The traditional adaptation practices used include use of organic manure (x¯ = 3.89), traditional organic composting (x¯ = 3.80), afforestation (x¯ = 3.71), agroforestry (x¯ = 3.61), crop rotation (x¯ = 3.40), and mulching (x¯ = 3.37). These practices not only help in adapting to climate change but also contribute to mitigating its effects by enhancing carbon sequestration and biodiversity. For instance, the use of organic manure by the study participants is due to their accessibility, cost-effectiveness, or perceived effectiveness in improving soil health and resilience against climate variability. Excerpts from the focus group discussion indicate that farmers unanimously agree that [“…they use organic manure due to their accessibility, cost-effectiveness, or perceived effectiveness in improving soil health and resilience against climate variability…”]. Hence, these practices indicate a level of knowledge and adaptation to local climatic conditions.\\nTable 3. Traditional adaptation practices farmers use to cushion the effect of climate change (n = 75).\\nTable 3. Traditional adaptation practices farmers use to cushion the effect of climate change (n = 75).\\nOther traditional adaptation practices include intercropping (x¯ = 3.36), planting of cover crops and irrigation (x¯ = 3.29), integrated crop-animal farming (x¯ = 3.21), bush fallow practices (x¯ = 3.13), and among others. The use of intercropping and integrated crop-animal farming implies that indigenous people and communities prioritizes diversification as a key risk management strategy against the backdrop of climate change. Additionally, the use of irrigation, bush fallowing and covering crops indicates an awareness of and response to the need for optimal resource utilization, maintenance of soil health and sustainability, which is crucial for long-term agricultural productivity in the face of climate change.\\n3.4 Possible reasons for using traditional approaches to climate change adaptation\\nTable 4 presents the key reasons for using traditional approaches to climate change adaptation. The reasons identified include increased soil fertility (x¯ = 2.95), aeration of soil (x¯ = 2.85), reduction of soil erosion (x¯ = 2.73), increase in soil moisture (x¯ = 2.03), enhancement of soil structure and aggregation (x¯ = 2.79), promotion of mineralization of nitrogen-containing compounds in the soil through the use of leguminous crops (x¯ = 2.68), reduction of nutrient loss from the soil (x¯ = 2.73), reduction of chemical pollution in the soil (x¯ = 2.33), and enhancement of agro-biodiversity through intercropping of legumes (x¯ = 2.56). This implies that farmers are aware of the importance of soil health in sustainable farming and climate change adaptation. This reflects a desire to maintain sustainable, eco-friendly farming practices that not only benefit the current crop but also contribute to the long-term health of the farm ecosystem. The reliance on traditional methods to deliver these benefits indicates a strong base of traditional agricultural knowledge and practices well-suited to local environmental conditions that have been passed down through generations. While these traditional practices are beneficial, there is potential for enhancing their effectiveness through the integration of scientific research and modern agricultural techniques.\\nTable 4. Possible reasons for using traditional approaches to climate change adaptation.\\nTable 4. Possible reasons for using traditional approaches to climate change adaptation.\\n3.5 Constraints to adapting traditional agriculture to climate change\\nTable 5 presents the constraints identified by the respondents to the use of traditional adaptation strategies. The major constraints to adaptation include climate variation leading to drought and high cost of accessing weather information (x¯ = 1.93), and inadequate funding (x¯ = 1.92). Access to micro-climate cues and finances are crucial in building local adaptation strategies. High cost of accessing reliable weather information frustrates traditional adaptive measures, making it difficult for farmers to plan and make informed climate-smart decisions effectively. It is therefore imperative to provide a more accessible, affordable, and accurate weather forecasting services tailored for farmers alongside financial assistance programs, subsidies, or microfinance solutions targeted at smallholder farmers. Participants also indicated that lack of technical knowledge and know-how (x¯ = 1.89) pose a major challenge to adapt. Mrs. Ngozika, a rural farmer from the study participant stated thus [“…I do not know the practical steps I could take to improve my farm activities in this era of climate change…”]. This implies a gap in the knowledge and skills necessary to implement effective adaptation strategies, which could probably be due to inadequate extension services or training programs. Inadequate infrastructure (x¯ = 1.87), such as roads and storage facilities, limits the ability of farmers to adapt to and mitigate the impacts of climate change. There is a need for governmental and non-governmental bodies to invest in rural infrastructure to support agricultural activities. Also, inadequate access to climate change information (x¯ = 1.85) present a formidable obstacle to rural adaptive capacities. This aligns with the high cost of accessing weather information and highlights a broader issue of information accessibility. Vulnerability to pests and diseases (x¯ = 1.83) resulting from climate change bedevils farmers adaptation efforts. Therefore, research into and promotion of climate-resilient crop varieties and integrated pest management practices are crucial for traditional agricultural systems. Other constraints faced by farmers include inadequate credit facilities (x¯ = 1.79), poor agricultural program and service delivery (x¯ = 1.69), high economic losses from farming (x¯ = 1.65), among others.\\nTable 5. Constraints to adaptation.\\nTable 5. Constraints to adaptation.\\nTable 6 presents the results of the factor analysis of the constraints to adaptation. The variables with a loading of 0.4 score and above were included in naming the factors. Variables that loaded in more than one factor or had loadings below 0.4 were not used. Two key factors were identified and named: a technical problem (Factor 1) and a climate information problem (Factor 2). Under the technical problem (Factor 1), the major constraints identified by farmers include poor agricultural program and service delivery (loading = 0.768), high cost of farm operations (loading = 0.663), lack of skilled laboratory facilities for farm practices (loading = 0.650), inconsistent government policies (loading = 0.580), lack of extension services for providing information to farmers (loading = 0.539), high economic losses from farming (loading = 0.500), and vulnerability to pests and diseases (loading = 0.487). In Factor 2, the climate informational problem includes the high cost of accessing weather information (loading = 0.692) and drought climate variation (loading = 0.515). The factor analysis provides a clear framework for understanding the complex array of challenges in agricultural adaptation, emphasizing the need for comprehensive, well-coordinated responses that address both immediate technical issues and longer-term climate information accessibility challenges.\\nTable 6. Varimax rotated factors on constraints to adaptation.\\nTable 6. Varimax rotated factors on constraints to adaptation.\\n3.6 Possible strategies to adapt and mitigate the effect of climate change\\nTable 7 presents the respondents' responses regarding adopting respective mitigation measures. The major strategies adopted by farmers include the use of organic manure (x¯ = 3.87), use of resistant crops (score x¯ = 3.85), use of drought-resistant crops (x¯ = 3.68), and use of flood-tolerant crops (x¯ = 3.73). Farmers can adopt resistant crop varieties that are better suited to withstand the impacts of climate change, such as drought, extreme temperatures, and pests. Also, afforestation (planting trees; x¯ = 3.67), and use of use of cover crops (x¯ = 3.47) are important strategies to adapt and mitigate the effect of climate change. Excerpts from the focus group discussion indicate that farmers unanimously agree that [“…Planting palm, orange, and gmelina help remove climate pollutants from the atmosphere, contribute to climate change mitigation and provide additional benefits such as soil conservation and biodiversity enhancement…”]. Furthermore, the participant indicated access to reliable weather forecasting services (x¯ = 3.86) could help farmers make informed decisions and adapt their farming practices to changing climate conditions, thereby mitigating risks associated with irregular rainfall patterns. Famers also indicated that climate-smart agriculture practices (x¯ = 3.93) are important adaptation strategies. Implementing climate-smart agricultural practices, such as conservation tillage, diversified crop rotations, and rotational grazing, could effectively mitigate climate change impacts by sequestering carbon and enhancing soil health.\\nTable 7. Possible strategies to adopt and mitigate the effect of climate change (n = 75).\\nTable 7. Possible strategies to adopt and mitigate the effect of climate change (n = 75).\\nOther important strategies identified by the respondents include incorporation of residues into the soil (x¯ = 3.23), proper conservation of seeds (x¯ = 3.75), provision of adequate mulching materials (x¯ = 3.40), among others. These strategies align with the principles of climate-resilient agriculture, which aims to enhance the adaptive capacity of agricultural systems and reduce their vulnerability to climate change while contributing to climate change mitigation.\\nTable 8 shows the Varimax rotated factors of possible strategies to adopt and mitigate the effect of climate change. Variables that had loadings of 0.4 and above being included in naming the factors. Variables that loaded in more than one factor or had loadings below 0.4 were not used. Two factors were identified and named: agronomic methods (Factor 1) and research methods (Factor 2). Under the agronomic methods (Factor 1), the major strategies identified by farmers include changing the timing of farm operations (loading = 0.777), availability of extension service delivery (loading = 0.774), incorporation of residues into the soil (loading = 0.738), provision of adequate mulching materials (loading = 0.674), provision of infrastructure (loading = 0.550), use of resistant crops (loading = 0.535), and afforestation (loading = 0.414). In Factor 2, the research methods, the strategies identified are proper conservation of seeds (loading = 0.580), provision of adequate farm input supplies (loading = 0.437), and increased investment in agricultural research and development (loading = 0.424).\\nTable 8. Varimax rotated factors of possible strategies to adopt and mitigate the effect of climate change.\\nTable 8. Varimax rotated factors of possible strategies to adopt and mitigate the effect of climate change.\\n4.1 Demographic characteristics of the farmers\\nThe United Nations reports that households in three Sub-Saharan African countries have an average of over 6 members each. Senegal stands out with one of the largest household sizes in Africa, averaging 10.8 members (United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division, 2019). These significant household sizes in Sub-Saharan Africa contribute to a valuable pool of labor for agricultural activities. The substantial household sizes in sub-Saharan Africa serve as a valuable labor reservoir for agricultural activities. Mr. Ode, a rural farmer said […I cannot afford machineries hence I use local labor, often involving family and friends…]. Compared to other regions such as North America and Europe, sub-Saharan Africa has larger average household size of 6.9 (Galal, 2023; Pew Research Center, 2023). This aligns with the result of this study of a mean household size of 6.43 people, indicating the families are relatively large and can contribute as a source of labor for farming activities. Thereby giving room for farming household to spend their extra income on other adaptive expenses. The empirical evidence from Swaziland underscored that sub-Saharan African countries could bear the brunt of climate change in terms of increased incidence of poverty and economic decline, with potential impacts on household welfare (Sam et al., 2021). The decrease in agricultural production due to the effects of climate change is a key contributing factor to farmers' reduced income. Findings showed that farmers have relatively low-income, indicating their reliance on income generated from the sales of their agricultural produce. This aligns firmly with related studies from sub-Saharan Africa (Ayanlade et al., 2018; Steinert et al., 2018; Ogada et al., 2020; Nwonu et al., 2022), which indicated that farmers within the region rely on personal savings. Farming experience is crucial to building climate resilience in traditional farming systems. Findings show that farmers have an average farming experience of 21.88 years, this implies that farmers in sub-Saharan Africa possess considerable experience addressing climate change issues in their farming practices, including adaptation and mitigation strategies (Sani and Chalchisa, 2016). However, support from governments and other organizations is crucial to enhance farmers' adaptation capacity and improve their access to resources and information.\\n4.2 Sources of information by farmers on climate change adaptation\\nSmallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa heavily rely on the environment for their livelihoods, making climate change adaptation crucial for their resilience. To achieve this, timely information on climate change adaptation strategies is vital. Although, there is limited information on the trend in climate information sources in sub-Saharan Africa. However, a study on smallholder farmers' climate resilience in Malawi and Ghana suggests that the relevance of information sources on climate change resilience is place-specific, and some sources may impede resilience (Amoak et al., 2023). Findings from the present study showed that across various survey regions, the main avenues through which individuals access information about climate change prominently include radio broadcasts, interactions with fellow farmers, and in-person discussions with neighbors. This widespread pattern of information dissemination aligns with the findings of multiple studies conducted not only in Anambra, as highlighted by Nwabugwu et al. (2019) and Uzochukwu et al. (2021), but also in diverse sub-Saharan African contexts. One of the noteworthy aspects of this information-sharing framework is the pivotal role of radio as a powerful and accessible medium for effectively communicating climate-related knowledge to diverse target groups across the region. According to and Antwi-Agyei et al. (2021) radio has proven to be a versatile tool in disseminating climate change information to both rural and urban communities, bridging information gaps, and promoting awareness and understanding of climate-related challenges. Additionally, community radio stations have been recognized for their ability to reach huge audiences and disseminate location-specific weather reporting, making them an effective tool for sharing climate information (Harvey et al., 2019; Global Center on Adaptation, 2023). This underscores the significance of radio as a primary and trusted source of climate-related information in sub-Saharan Africa.\\nIn addition to radio, the significance of peer interactions, particularly with fellow farmers and neighboring community members, emerges as a vital information source in the present study. A study on farmers' social networks and regional spillover effects in agricultural climate change mitigation emphasizes the positive influence of peer interactions on farmers' uptake of climate change adaptation measures (Kreft et al., 2023). Furthermore, a systematic review of smallholder farmers' climate change adaptation in sub-Saharan African indicated that knowledge integration and sharing within farming communities is important for adaptation to climate change (Jellason et al., 2022). This interpersonal exchange of knowledge within farming communities fosters the sharing of practical experiences, locally relevant adaptation strategies, and mitigation measures. Farmers can learn from one another's successes and challenges, making peer interactions a crucial component of climate change education and resilience-building efforts. It is important to acknowledge that while these channels are prevalent, there are variations in their prominence and effectiveness across sub-Saharan Africa's diverse regions and cultural contexts.\\n4.3 Effective traditional adaptation practices farmers use to cushion the effect of climate change\\nTraditional adaptation practices are crucial for enhancing the climate change resilience of smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa. Findings show that all the tested traditional practices have high adoption rates as farmers utilize them to mitigate and adapt to climate change to minimize its effects. This aligns with the findings of the Crace (2019), which revealed that rural farmers have developed various strategies to reduce the impact of climate change, and these strategies have been tested and proven effective, reflecting farmers' perceptions and serving as effective mitigation and adaptation strategies. The increased application of organic manure by farmers serves multiple purposes, including enhancing soil fertility sustainably and increasing soil moisture content. Farmers noted that with rising temperatures and increased evapotranspiration caused by climate change, preserving moisture for crop use is crucial, making organic manure, planting of cover crops, bush fallow and mulching preferred options. They also emphasized that organic manure is cost-effective and readily available compared to inorganic fertilizers. This aligns with the findings of Quarshie et al. (2023) that traditional agricultural practitioners in sub-Saharan Africa implement on-farm adaptation options such as water management, and soil conservation techniques to combat climate change. Results showed that farmers deployed crop rotation, mixed cropping, intercropping, integrated crop-animal irrigation practices and shifting cultivation as key traditional soil and water management practices to adapt food crop production to climate change (Olumba et al., 2020; Benhin, 2021). This aligns with the findings of Naazie et al. (2023) who found that rural farmers in Ghana use crop diversification, intercropping, mixed farming and the adoption of improved crop varieties to adapt their agricultural production to climate change.\\nAfforestation and agroforestry are important practices for promoting sustainable land use and mitigating the effects of climate change in sub-Saharan Africa. Results from the present study showed that farmers used afforestation and agroforestry techniques as an effective adaptation strategy as opposed mitigation strategy. These offers one of the most promising technological options for reversing soil degradation, restoring tree cover, and improving agricultural productivity in Africa. Famers reported the key agroforestry practices that helped them to adapt their agricultural system to climate change to include grazing or farming under savanna trees, growing coffee or cocoa under shade trees, planting fruit trees, sowing tree seeds on fallow land to speed up the restoration of fertility, planting “living” fences, windbreaks, or woodlots, combining trees, shrubs, and field crops in multistoried cropping systems, and growing crops between rows of nitrogen-fixing trees or shrubs (“alley cropping”). On the other hand, farmers also reported their engagement in tree planting campaigns in areas where there was no forest cover previously. In sub-Saharan Africa, afforestation programs have been implemented to combat deforestation and land degradation (Chomba et al., 2020). This is an effective traditional way of increasing soil cover, sequester carbon and mitigate the effects of climate change on rural agriculture.\\n4.4 Possible reasons for using traditional approaches to climate change adaptation\\nSub-Saharan African countries are incorporating traditional approaches to climate change adaptation due to their effectiveness and relevance to local conditions. Findings indicate that adopting traditional agricultural practices for climate change adaptation delivers multi-faceted benefits including enhancing soil quality and crop productivity by altering soil structure, promoting nutrient cycling, and reducing pests and diseases. Peoples and Baldock (2020) reported that crop rotation can increase the production of subsequent crops. Niggli et al. (2019) also stated that organic matter enhances soil resistance to drought and makes them adaptable to low and high rainfall conditions. Famers reported that improving over soil health, soil organic matter and crop yield, reducing greenhouse gas emission and enhancing resilience against climate variability are the major reasons why they use traditional approaches such as use of organic manure, traditional organic composting, afforestation and agroforestry, among others. The utilization of these techniques highlights the importance of diversifying agricultural practices to enhance climate resilience, which can serve as a model for other regions grappling with similar challenges. For instance, the successful implementation of afforestation and agroforestry initiatives in Southeast Nigeria as a means of enhancing the productivity of farming business demonstrates their potential as nature-based solutions to climate change that can be scaled up in similar agro-ecosystems. As climate change continues to pose challenges to agricultural systems across the continent, sharing and scaling up these effective practices can contribute significantly to building climate-resilient farming communities and ensuring food security for future generations in sub-Saharan Africa.\\n4.5 Constraints to adapting traditional agriculture to climate change\\nSmallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa face multifaceted challenges as they seek to adapt traditional agriculture to climate change. Lead farmers in the present study reported that poor agricultural extension services, pest and disease vulnerability, and inadequate dissemination of climate change information due to limited extension services are factors that hinder climate change adaptation, which corroborates the research conducted by Satishkumar et al. (2020). Studies in Nigeria and Ghana have highlighted constraints such as inadequate finance, scarcity of labor, inadequate access to climate information, and lack of access to weather information as significant barriers to farmers' efforts to adapt to climate change (Abegunde et al., 2019; Ige et al., 2021). Additionally, unpredictable weather conditions have been identified as a serious constraint to climate change adaptation strategies in Northern Ghana, affecting arable crop farmers' choice of adaptation strategies (Ige et al., 2021). On the other hand, findings showed that farmers do not have the knowledge to determine the level of accuracy of their climate information, because they never had real-time access to climate information. However, Fagariba et al. (2018) suggested that the inadequacy, inaccuracy, and inconsistency of climatic information available to farmers pose constraints in weather forecasting as an adaptation strategy to climate change. Furthermore, the high cost of accessing weather forecast information and its incompatibility with farmers' needs also hampers the adoption of weather forecasting as a reliable means of coping with the effects of climate change (Ojo et al., 2018). The result of the factor analysis resolved the constraints encountered by farmers into two components namely technical production and climate information problems. This is in tandem with the findings of Autio et al. (2021) who found that smallholder farmers in Southeast Kenya face challenges in adopting climate-smart agricultural practices due to limited access to productive resources and climate uncertainty. This is probably because formal climate adaptation strategies in sub-Saharan Africa often fail to consider the agency of smallholder farmers, leading to a disconnect between the strategies and the farmers' actual adaptation practices and needs. Addressing these constraints is crucial for the successful implementation of climate-smart agricultural practices and the resilience of agricultural systems in the region.\\n4.6 Possible strategies to adapt and mitigate the effect of climate change in traditional agricultural systems\\nClimate change poses significant challenges to traditional agricultural systems in sub-Saharan Africa. Smallholder farmers in the region have been adapting to a changing climate, but there is a need for more comprehensive strategies to mitigate its effects. Farmers in the study area indicated that the use of climate-smart agriculture, the use of resistant crop varieties, afforestation, and other identified strategies can effectively mitigate the effects of climate change. This finding aligns with the research conducted by Ali et al. (2019), who highlighted the importance of using resistant crop varieties to adapt and build resilience to the effects of climate change. Resistant crops are known to survive and complete their life cycles even in adverse environmental conditions, providing a useful adaptation strategy (Barasa et al., 2021). Similarly, Jellason et al. (2022) indicated that on-farm adaptation options, agro-ecological intensification (AEI) practices, diversification and intercropping, adoption of improved crop varieties and soil and water management practices are crucial adaptation strategies to climate change in sub-Saharan Africa dry lands. The results further demonstrate that farmers have developed and tested various strategies to reduce the effects of climate change. This highlights their proactive approach to adopting measures to mitigate climate change and their ability to innovate and adapt to the changing environment. The results from the factor analysis categorized the strategies adopted by farmers into two categories namely agronomic methods and research methods for adaptation. Farmers indicated that adjusting the timing of farm operations, availability of extension services, incorporating crop residues into the soil, provision of mulching materials, infrastructure, and adoption of resistant crops and afforestation, are vital agronomic strategies to adapt traditional agriculture to climate change. In terms of the research methods to adaptations, farmers highlight the importance of proper seed conservation, availability of adequate farm inputs, and increased investment in agricultural research and development as crucial aspects to address in enhancing the resilience of their agricultural systems to climate change.\\nThis study provides valuable insights into the socioeconomic characteristics of farmers and their practices in adapting to climate change. The findings highlight the significant role of women in rural areas and their involvement in sustainable agriculture practices, as evidenced by a higher percentage of female respondents. The large household size and relatively low-income levels underscore the importance of agriculture as a primary source of livelihood for these farmers. Farmers have considerable experience addressing climate change issues, indicating their potential to collaborate and implement effective adaptation and mitigation strategies. However, the study also reveals the reliance on limited sources of climate change information, such as radio and fellow farmers, indicating the need for improved dissemination channels and access to diverse sources of knowledge.\\nThe study highlights the prevalent use of climate-smart traditional agricultural practices among indigenous people, including organic manure application and mixed farming, demonstrating farmers' proactive approach to mitigating the effects of climate change. These practices enhance soil fertility and moisture retention and improve crop productivity and resilience. Nevertheless, the study identifies constraints such as poor extension services, limited access to climate information, and technical challenges that hinder effective adaptation. These constraints require enhanced support systems, policy interventions, and agricultural research and development investments. In light of the findings, promoting climate-smart agriculture, the use of resistant crop varieties, afforestation, and sustainable farming practices emerge as essential strategies to mitigate the effects of climate change. By addressing the identified constraints and building upon farmers' existing knowledge and experiences, we can enhance their resilience, improve agricultural productivity, and contribute to sustainable rural development.\\n5.1 Policy implications of the findings\\n• Strengthen extension services and diversify information sources: Governments should invest in and strengthen extension services to provide farmers with up-to-date climate change information, area-specific weather cues, agricultural best practices, and new technologies. And promote the use of diverse information sources, including indigenous channels, digital platforms and community-based knowledge sharing.\\n• Promote climate-smart agricultural practices: Encourage the adoption of climate-smart agricultural practices through incentives, subsidies, and training programs. Governments should support research and development in climate-resilient crop varieties and livestock breeds.\\n• Increase investment in agricultural research: Allocate more funding to agricultural research and innovation to develop climate-resilient technologies, improved crop varieties, and sustainable farming practices.\\n• Access to credit for climate-resilient infrastructure: Facilitate access to credit and financial services for farmers to invest in climate-resilient infrastructure, such as irrigation systems, drought-resistant seeds, and storage facilities.\\n• Supportive policies and collaborative networks: Create a conducive policy environment that encourages sustainable agricultural practices and promotes collaboration among various stakeholders, including government agencies, NGOs, and research institutions.\\n• Capacity-Building Workshops and Progress Monitoring: Organize capacity-building workshops and training programs for farmers, extension workers, and other stakeholders to enhance their knowledge and skills in climate adaptation and mitigation. And also implement regular progress monitoring and evaluation to assess the effectiveness of climate adaptation efforts.\\n• Enabling Environment for Continuous Learning and Improvement: Foster an environment that promotes continuous learning and improvement in agricultural practices. Encourage farmers to experiment with new techniques and technologies while providing them with the necessary support and resources.\\n• Collaboration among policymakers, researchers, and local communities: Promote collaboration and coordination among policymakers, researchers, and local communities to ensure that climate-resilient and sustainable agricultural practices are developed, disseminated, and adopted effectively.\\nData availability statement\\nThe raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be made available by the authors, without undue reservation.\\nThe studies involving humans were approved by University of Nigeria Research Ethics Committee.
